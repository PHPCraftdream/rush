var sessionsWhyCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "why <id>",
	Short: "Explain why a session has the status it has",
	Long: `Print a one-shot diagnostic explaining a session's current status
(running / crashed / done / at rest) and the evidence behind it, using
only data crush itself owns: the session/message DB and the lock file.

This is the command to reach for when "sessions list" shows a session as
"crashed" and you want to know whether it genuinely died mid-turn or
actually finished cleanly and left a stale lock behind. It does NOT read
external log files or orchestrator redirect output — only the DB and the
.crush/locks directory.

The four possible verdicts:

  done     — last assistant message finished with end_turn.
  crashed  — lock file exists, holder is dead (PID dead AND heartbeat
             stale), and no assistant message with a clean finish.
             Likely died mid-turn.
  running  — lock file exists, holder PID is alive OR the heartbeat is
             still fresh (PID alone is not trusted — on Windows it reads
             as unreadable for the entire lifetime of a live session).
  at rest  — no lock file. Not running, not crashed.

When the raw lock signal says "crashed" but the last assistant message
finished cleanly (end_turn), the verdict says so explicitly and treats
the session as done — this is the same reclassification "sessions list"
applies via reclassifyCrashedAsDone, surfaced here in plain language.`,
	Args: cobra.ExactArgs(1),
	Example: `
# Why does sessions list show this one as crashed?
crush sessions why pr-42

# Same, by hash prefix
crush sessions why 8a3f0c

	// explainSessionStatus's second-to-last string parameter is the root
	// whose "<root>/.crush/locks" subtree holds the session's lock file —
	// historically named cwd because setupApp's --data-dir-aware
	// resolution wasn't wired through here. Pass the already-resolved data
	// directory instead of the raw --cwd value so `sessions why` honors
	// --data-dir / a configured data_directory like `sessions list` /
	// `sessions locks` / `sessions watch` do (task #233 — same
	// cwd-hardcoding bug class as #219/#224/#231).

// explainSessionStatus writes a terse, plain-text explanation of why the
// session has the status it has. It is the testable core of
// `crush sessions why`: it takes the app services, the resolved data
// directory (for the locks dir), the session id, and an output writer, so
// tests can drive it with a hand-built *app.App and a t.TempDir() without
// spinning up cobra.
//
// dataDir is the crush data directory itself (e.g. what
// a.Config().Options.DataDirectory resolves to — honoring --data-dir / a
// configured data_directory), NOT the project cwd: the lock file lives at
// <dataDir>/locks/session-<id>.lock, one level shallower than the old
// <cwd>/.crush/locks layout this parameter used to assume. See task #233
// (same cwd-hardcoding bug class as #219/#224/#231): the caller used to
// pass the raw --cwd value here, ignoring --data-dir entirely.
//
// It deliberately mirrors the two-step status computation that
// `sessions list` uses (computeSessionStatuses → reclassifyCrashedAsDone)
// but for a single session, and adds the "at rest" case those helpers
// don't represent (they only return entries for sessions that HAVE a lock).
