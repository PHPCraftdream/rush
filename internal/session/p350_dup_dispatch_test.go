// P350 regression tests (found across the third and fourth @oh review
// passes over #337-349, 2026-08-10): run_queue_pump.go's executeEntry
// treated Coordinator.Run's nil error as unconditional success and Acked
// (deleted) the durable row regardless of whether the call actually ran.
// agent.sessionAgent.Run returns (nil, nil) — not an error — when the
// target session is already owned by a live, in-process turn: the call is
// merely appended to that owner's mailbox queue (mailbox.submit
// unconditionally appends, no dedup), not executed by this call.
//
// This was reachable three ways:
//  1. Same-tick (third pass): tick() leases and `go executeEntry`-dispatches
//     entries one at a time in a single pass; two distinct durably-queued
//     entries for the same session (e.g. two calls queued while a process
//     was down) could be leased and dispatched back to back within the
//     same tick, before either had run long enough to matter.
//  2. Sequential self-inflicted (found by the third pass, actually fixed by
//     the fourth): RunQueueLeaseTTL (30s) is far shorter than a real LLM
//     turn can take. The third pass's inFlight guard (below) does NOT
//     close this path on its own — inFlight only blocks a SECOND
//     concurrent dispatch while the first goroutine is still tracked as
//     busy; it does nothing about the underlying DB row silently flipping
//     from 'leased' to 'pending' out from under a still-running execution.
//     Without lease renewal, CleanupExpiredLeases would do exactly that
//     after 30s, and the ORIGINAL goroutine's own eventual AckRunQueueEntry
//     (`WHERE status = leased`) would then silently fail to match (logged,
//     not delete anything), leaving the row pending for a LATER tick to
//     lease and dispatch — a genuine duplicate execution of the same turn,
//     sequential rather than concurrent, but exactly as harmful.
//  3. External busy-then-recovered (found by the fourth pass): the original
//     fix for ErrCallQueuedNotExecuted (see below) left the entry exactly
//     as leased and untouched, relying solely on CleanupExpiredLeases's
//     natural lease-expiry as its recovery path — but that same cleanup
//     unconditionally increments attempts on every recovery. A session
//     that stayed externally busy for RunQueueMaxAttempts lease windows (a
//     few minutes) would have its accepted, never-actually-failed work
//     silently dead-lettered (deleted) — the same class of bug
//     SessionLockBusyError's no-attempt-penalty handling exists to prevent
//     for the equivalent cross-process OS-lock case.
//
// Fixed:
//  1. RunQueuePump.inFlight tracks session IDs with an executeEntry
//     goroutine currently running FROM THIS PUMP INSTANCE; processEntry
//     refuses to lease a pending entry for a session already in that set.
//     Closes path 1 above at the source — the pump itself can never
//     concurrently dispatch two entries for one session.
//  2. executeEntry now runs a renewal loop (ticker at leaseTTL/3) alongside
//     Coordinator.Run, calling the new RenewRunQueueLease query to push
//     lease_expires_at forward — scoped to `status = leased AND leased_by
//     = ?` so a lease already reassigned to a different owner is never
//     silently extended out from under it. Closes path 2: a still-running
//     execution's lease can no longer expire underneath it under normal
//     scheduling.
//  3. session.ErrCallQueuedNotExecuted is returned by
//     coordinatorAdapterImpl.Run when the underlying call returns (nil,
//     nil) — i.e. queued into a genuinely EXTERNAL live owner the inFlight
//     guard has no visibility into. executeEntry treats this specially: no
//     Ack (the row would be deleted for work that has not actually run),
//     and — closing path 3 — an immediate
//     NackRunQueueEntryNoAttemptPenalty release (never counts an attempt,
//     mirroring SessionLockBusyError's own handling) paired with a LOCAL
//     RunQueuePump.busyBackoffUntil deadline so THIS pump instance does not
//     immediately re-lease and re-dispatch the same entry on the very next
//     tick — mailbox.submit appends unconditionally on every call, so an
//     uncontrolled retry loop would append a new duplicate on every
//     attempt. A single RenewRunQueueLease call was tried first and did NOT
//     work: it happens almost instantly after the original lease, barely
//     extending lease_expires_at beyond what leasing already set, so
//     CleanupExpiredLeases still reaped the row (and charged an attempt)
//     after essentially one ordinary TTL window — same as doing nothing.
//
// RunQueueLeaseTTL itself (30s) is not test-overridable, which made path 2
// impossible to exercise deterministically and quickly with a real timed
// test — RunQueuePumpConfig.TestLeaseTTL (mirroring the existing TestTick
// seam) was added to close that gap; see
// TestReleaseGate_P350_LeaseRenewedDuringLongExecution and
// TestReleaseGate_P350_QueuedNotExecutedBacksOffWithoutAttemptPenalty below.

// not been observed to flake across many runs (the round trip is a fast,

// principle interleave a cleanup pass between lease and Nack and charge one
// spurious attempt. If this test ever flakes on `attempts == 0`, that is the

	// Weak predicate, kept deliberately — this is the third
	// `len(pending) == 0` site in this file and the only one 5c160413
	// did not convert to runQueueGoneEverywhere. It is safe here, and
	// only here, because of three facts specific to this test:
	//
	//   1. It is the LAST statement — nothing after it is ordered by
	//      the wait, so the wait cannot mis-order any assertion.
	//   2. The test's teeth live entirely in the preceding wait:
	//      `calls > busyUntilCall` proves the entry survived 25 busy
	//      cycles without dead-lettering AND that the 26th (successful)
	//      dispatch already ran. What this wait adds is a drain hint,
	//      not a proof.
	//   3. As an "acked" proof this predicate is close to vacuous
	//      anyway: a leased row is invisible to
	//      ListPendingRunQueueEntries, and during the busy phase the
	//      entry oscillates pending→leased→pending on every 20ms tick,
	//      so "pending empty" first becomes true within the FIRST
	//      lease — long before the successful call this message
	//      describes. Converting it to runQueueGoneEverywhere would
	//      make it mean what it says at zero cost, and MUST be done if
	//      any of the three facts above changes: the moment an
	//      assertion is added after this wait, or the coordinator's Run
	//      stops being instant (a slow 26th Run would let the wait
	//      return at the lease, before the Ack/dead-letter writes
	//      land), the pending-only form silently unorders whatever
	//      follows it.
