// P0-3 follow-up regression test, found during the closing review of the
// 2026-08-11 release-readiness round: executeEntry created a single dbCtx
// (30s absolute deadline) at function entry, BEFORE calling
// Coordinator.Run, then reused that same context for the post-Run outcome
// write (Ack/Nack/TerminalFail). Any turn longer than 30s hit an already-
// expired context on its outcome write — the write failed with "context
// deadline exceeded", the row stayed leased/pending instead of being
// deleted, and the next tick re-leased and re-executed the same call. That
// is exactly the duplicate-execution bug P0-3's workerWg join was
// introduced to prevent, reintroduced by the same commit via its own new
// dbCtx.
//
// The fix creates the DB write's context fresh, AFTER Coordinator.Run
// returns, via a per-call newDBCtx() closure — see executeEntry's own doc
// comment. TestDBWriteTimeout lets this test force that budget down to a
// few tens of milliseconds so a "long turn" can be simulated with a short
// sleep instead of a real 30+ second wait.
//
// REVERT CHECK: reverting to a single dbCtx created at function entry (the
// original P0-3 shape) makes this test fail with "ack failed after
// success ... context deadline exceeded" and the row still present in the
// database afterward.
