var sessionsReapCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "reap",
	Args:  cobra.NoArgs,
	Short: "Remove lock files proven (via a real OS lock probe) to have no live holder",
	Long: `Scan .rush/locks/ and remove any lock that a real OS-level lock
probe (actually attempting flock/LockFileEx) proves has no live holder.
Unlike the old PID/mtime heuristic — which could unlink a path out from
under a live OS lock (advisory locks are bound to the inode, not the path,
so the unlink didn't revoke the live holder, it just let a second process
create a fresh inode at the same path and believe it owned the session:
two owners of one session id) — reap now acquires the real lock per entry
and only removes files it could freely acquire.

Use --dry-run to see what would be reclaimed without touching anything.

Note: an empty lock file with no held OS lock is harmless (the next
acquirer reopens and overwrites it; see internal/session/lock.go's
Release). It is also what a CLEAN release leaves — a "rush run" loop
waiting between turns on a job, a delegation or a retry, or a web session
between turns, holds no lock — so reap keeps every lock file that records
no PID, unprobed (probing would take the lock the owner needs for its next
turn). Only locks that record a PID, which is what a crash leaves behind,
are probed and reclaimed; reap exists to tidy those for operators.

The legacy --all flag is accepted for backward compatibility but is now a
no-op: a lock that records a PID is removed if (and only if) the OS-lock
probe proves no live holder, regardless of --all; a lock with no readable
PID is kept.`,
	Example: `
rush sessions reap
rush sessions reap --dry-run
rush sessions reap --all      # legacy no-op
  `,
	RunE: sessionsReapCmdRun,

// reapRemoveRetryBudget bounds how long a whole sweep may spend retrying
