// P1-1 regression test (docs/reviews/2026-08-12-post-fix-release-readiness-follow-up.md):
// RunQueuePump.executeEntry cancels execCtx BEFORE lease expiry via an independent
// watchdog timer with a safety margin.
//
// The bug: before the fix, when RenewRunQueueLease hung (e.g., DB stall for the
// full 30s timeout), the executor would continue running for TTL + timeout (e.g.,
// 30s + 30s = 60s total) even though the lease expired at TTL (30s). During those
// extra ~30s, another pump instance could legitimately take ownership and start
// a duplicate execution. The fail-closed check (time.Since(lastSuccessfulRenewal) >= TTL)
// only ran BEFORE the DB call and repeated AFTER it returned, so it couldn't catch
// this case.
//
// The fix:
// 1. Add an independent watchdog timer (separate goroutine from renewal loop)
// 2. Watchdog fires at: time_of_last_renewal + TTL - safety_margin
// 3. Watchdog cancels execCtx when it fires, BEFORE another pump can take ownership
// 4. Each renewal gets a timeout = remaining safe budget (not fixed 30s)
//
// SEMANTICS: The watchdog provides a strong bound against double-execution even
// when DB stalls. Residual window is safety_margin + provider/tool cancellation latency,
// not the full TTL.
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE:
//  1. In run_queue_pump.go, disable the watchdog by setting its timer deadline
//     to TTL (instead of TTL - safety_margin) or removing the watchdog goroutine
//  2. This test will FAIL with the predicted symptom (cancellation happens AFTER
//     the full TTL + DB timeout window, not before), verifying the fix is needed.

// P0-3 fix note: this used to hang on ONLY the exact hangAfterAttemptNum

// sufficient before P0-3: the watchdog's old post-call-time tracking meant
// a single hung-then-recovered renewal cycle was enough to trip the
// fail-closed timeout reliably within the test's tight timing window. Once
// the watchdog is correctly DB-anchored (this fix), a single hang followed
// by healthy renewals lets the pump's OWN renewal loop legitimately
// self-heal — a later successful renewal simply extends the tracked
// deadline again, exactly as it's supposed to for a real recovered DB, so
// the watchdog may never fire at all if hangAfterAttemptNum's one bad
// attempt is followed by good ones (observed directly: intermittent "did
// not fire within Ns" test timeouts once TTLs were scaled up per P0-3 to
// accommodate lease_expires_at's whole-seconds granularity, since scaling
// up TTL also gives more real-time room for a later attempt to land and
// recover before the watchdog's deadline). Hanging on every attempt from
// hangAfterAttemptNum onward (not just the one) is what actually simulates
// "the DB stays stuck," which is the scenario these tests are meant to
