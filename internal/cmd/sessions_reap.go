var sessionsReapCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "reap",
	Short: "Remove lock files proven (via a real OS lock probe) to have no live holder",
	Long: `Scan .rush/locks/ and remove any lock that a real OS-level lock
probe (actually attempting flock/LockFileEx) proves has no live holder.
Unlike the old PID/mtime heuristic — which could unlink a path out from
under a live OS lock (advisory locks are bound to the inode, not the path,
so the unlink didn't revoke the live holder, it just let a second process
create a fresh inode at the same path and believe it owned the session:
two owners of one session id) — reap now acquires the real lock per entry
and only removes files it could freely acquire.

Use --dry-run to see what would be reclaimed without touching anything.

Note: an empty lock file with no held OS lock is harmless (the next
acquirer reopens and overwrites it; see internal/session/lock.go's
Release), so removing these files is cosmetic cleanup, not a correctness
requirement — reap exists to keep the locks directory tidy for operators.

The legacy --all flag is accepted for backward compatibility but is now a
no-op: removal is decided solely by the OS-lock probe, so a lock with an
unreadable PID is removed if (and only if) the probe proves no live holder,
regardless of --all.`,
	Example: `
rush sessions reap
rush sessions reap --dry-run
rush sessions reap --all      # also nuke locks with unreadable PIDs
  `,
	RunE: sessionsReapCmdRun,
}

// reapRemoveRetryBudget bounds how long a whole sweep may spend retrying
// unlinks of locks it has already proven dead — shared across every lock,
// not granted per lock. It only has to outlast a handle that is on its way
// out (see the call site), so seconds, not tens of seconds: a handle still
// open after this is held by something that is not going to let go, and
// reporting the failure beats hanging the sweep.
