// KillProcess forcibly terminates the process tree rooted at pid.
//
// Tracked pids (registered via TrackProcessTree at spawn time) are killed
// by BOTH mechanisms below, deliberately not short-circuited: taskkill
// /F /T first, then the Job Object. The two mechanisms have disjoint
// blind spots — taskkill /T walks the PPID chain and so cannot see past
// the MSYS2/Git-Bash transient intermediary parent (job membership
// reaches those), while the job cannot see a process that escaped in the
// Start→AssignProcessToJobObject micro-gap and IS PPID-reachable when
// crush itself does not run under MSYS (taskkill reaches those).
// Returning early on a successful TerminateJobObject — the shape this
// function had after 68f9c65f — silently dropped that second case: the
// job terminated "successfully", KillProcess reported nil, and the
// escapee survived with its fallback explicitly disabled. taskkill runs
// BEFORE the job pass because /T needs the root alive to walk from and
// the job termination kills the root. Cost: one taskkill spawn per kill
// of a tracked child; kill paths only run on stream cancellation, never
// per-stream, so this is not hot.
//
// On Windows os.Process.Kill() goes through OpenProcess(PROCESS_TERMINATE)
// which can fail with "Access is denied" for processes spawned under a
// different shell (Git Bash / MSYS, elevated console host, etc.). We
// prefer two more reliable paths:
//
//  1. taskkill /F /T /PID <pid> — kills the process plus every child it
//     spawned. This is what crush sessions kill actually wants because
//     a stuck crush.exe usually has a claude.cmd / node.exe descendant
//     still holding its stdin pipe.
//  2. As a fallback (taskkill not on PATH) OpenProcess + TerminateProcess
//     via golang.org/x/sys/windows.
//
// Returns nil if the process is already gone. Caller is expected to poll
// IsProcessAlive afterwards.
