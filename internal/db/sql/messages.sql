-- task #595 (P1-1 of the 2026-08-19 static follow-up review): plain
-- DeleteMessage above deletes an assistant message unconditionally, even
-- while an agent turn still owns it (no terminal Finish yet, or only a
-- Partial one from the auto-checkpoint ticker). The turn's terminal write
-- lands afterward through UpdateMessage/UpdateMessageIfNotTerminal and, at
-- the time this predicate was added, published UpdatedEvent regardless of
-- whether the row still existed -- "resurrecting" a deleted message in the
-- live UI only, absent from the DB, until the next reload wipes it again.
--
-- A DB predicate is used instead of read-then-delete (Get, check
-- IsFinished(), then DeleteMessage) because a Get-then-act pair is not
-- atomic: nothing stops the turn's own write from landing in the gap between
-- the read and the delete. The WHERE clause here makes the check and the
-- delete a single statement.
--
-- role != 'assistant' is deliberate, not merely permissive: only assistant
-- rows are ever streamed (see message.Message.IsFinished's doc), so user/
-- system/tool rows have no live turn that could contest a delete and must
-- remain deletable exactly as before. finished_at IS NOT NULL is the same
-- terminal test IsFinished() applies in Go, evaluated in SQL for atomicity.
--
-- is_summary_message = 1 is ALSO exempt, and this is not merely permissive
-- either: the risk this predicate defends against is an EXTERNAL actor (an
-- operator's Trash click or bulk-selection delete, reached through the web
-- UI) deleting a message a DIFFERENT, still-live turn intends to keep
-- writing to. A summary message (internal/agent/agent_compaction.go's
-- runSummarizeSilent/runSummarizeBody) is never reachable through that UI
-- at all -- web/src/components/Message/Message.tsx routes IsSummaryMessage
-- rows to SummaryMessage.tsx, which renders no Trash control and is outside
-- the selection-checkbox tree entirely -- so the only caller that ever
-- deletes one is the SAME turn that created it, cleaning up its own
-- abandoned draft after its own stream was cancelled, before writing
-- anything else to that id. That is single-writer self-cleanup, not the
-- external race this predicate exists to prevent, and gating it here caused
-- a real regression (TestP1_4_CleanupUsesCancelImmuneContext in
-- internal/agent/p1_3_p1_4_regression_test.go) where the cancel-path
-- cleanup delete of an unfinished summary message was wrongly refused.
--
-- Returns rows affected: 0 means either the row didn't exist, or it exists
-- but is a still-streaming (non-summary) assistant message and the delete
-- was refused. Service.Delete disambiguates those two cases with a

--
-- This is the fix for the cross-statement race in read_delegation_transcript.go:
-- previously Count() and ListPaginated() were two independent queries, so a

-- total), then fetches the window strictly at-or-before that boundary via
-- ListMessagesBySessionOlderThanCreatedAt + ListMessagesBySessionAtCreatedAt.
-- Any message inserted after this query executes is newer than the pinned
-- boundary and is therefore correctly excluded from both the "total" figure

--      If a newer user/assistant message lands before this write, the

--      on, and stamping the older message would show a spurious "Process
--      restarted" on a turn that already has a live successor.
--   2. A plain UPDATE ... WHERE id = ? has no way to notice #1, and also
--      clobbers any Parts content the live owner wrote in the same window
--      (e.g. a checkpoint tick) since the write is not conditioned on the

--
-- This mirrors DeleteMessageIfTerminal / UpdateMessageIfNotTerminal: the

--     used to do after the initial Get, now enforced in the same statement
--     as the write instead of a separate round trip before it)

--     session's chronologically last message, using rowid rather than
--     created_at for the same reason as ListCandidateInterruptedAssistantSessions
--     and ListMessagesBySession: created_at is second-granularity, so a
