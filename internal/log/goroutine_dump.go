// cannot block on a stuck disk or network mount, and can safely be called
// synchronously from a context where an unbounded block is unacceptable
// (see the stream watchdog's onFire, in internal/agent/agent.go).
//
// This exists because a hung rush process was, in practice, undiagnosable.
// pprof is compiled in (main.go imports net/http/pprof) but only served when
// RUSH_PROFILE is set, so an operator who hits a hang cannot retroactively
// enable it on the already-running process. Release binaries are built with
// stripped symbols, so attaching a debugger yields "could not find goroutine
// array" — and the attach attempt itself killed the only live instance of the
// bug we had. The result was a real, reproducible freeze whose cause could
// only be guessed at from source reading.
//
// runtime.Stack needs no symbols, no open port and no operator action, so
// calling this at the moment a hang is DETECTED captures the evidence
// automatically, in release builds, exactly once, at the only moment it is
// still available — but only if the capture itself runs synchronously with
// the detection. Deferring it to an async goroutine risks capturing the
// state AFTER whatever unwound the hang (e.g. an outer cancellation) rather
// than the hang itself, or never running at all if the process exits first.
// WriteGoroutineDump, in contrast, is pure I/O and safe to dispatch async.
