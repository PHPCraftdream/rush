// P1-1 regression test (docs/reviews/2026-08-11-release-readiness-concurrency-and-code-review.md):
// closes a real "Add concurrently with Wait" race in agent.go's Run() and
// Summarize() entry points. Before the fix, both called runWg.Add(1) and then
// checked shuttingDown as two separate, unsynchronized steps — between the
// Add and the check, a concurrent CancelAll could set shuttingDown and spin
// up its runWg.Wait() goroutine while the counter was still 0, letting Wait()
// return (nothing registered yet) a moment before the Add(1) landed. Per the
// sync.WaitGroup contract ("calls with a positive delta that start when the
// counter is zero must happen before a Wait"), this either panics at runtime
// or lets a new Run/Summarize start after CancelAll has already told its caller
// shutdown was safe — reintroducing the exact class of bug P0-3/P0-4 exist
// to close. The fix gates both the check and the Add under one mutex
// (admitMu/stopping, mirroring P0-3's RunQueuePump pattern).
//
// This test exercises tryAdmitRunWg directly (package agent, not agent_test,
// specifically to reach the unexported method and fields) by flipping the
// gate manually — deterministic, rather than trying to time a real CancelAll()
// call against a real dispatch within a few microseconds.
//
// SCOPE NOTE (added on independent review): the three tests below
// (TestP1_1_AdmissionGateRejectsRun/Summarize/AllowsBeforeShuttingDown)
// only check runWg's state AFTER Run()/Summarize() has already returned.
// That is not a valid discriminator: even the ORIGINAL unsynchronized code
// (`runWg.Add(1)` then `defer runWg.Done()` then, later, the shuttingDown
// check) leaves runWg balanced back to its prior count by the time the
// call returns, on EVERY return path — the bug is a pure timing race
// between a concurrent Add and a concurrent Wait, not an observable
// post-hoc imbalance. Verified directly: temporarily rewrote
// tryAdmitRunWg to the historical Add-then-check shape (Add(1) always,
// compensating Done() on the rejected path, no admitMu at all) and all
// three tests below still PASSED unchanged — the sixth vacuous-test
// occurrence in this babygoal round. Kept below anyway as functional
// smoke tests (they do prove Run/Summarize return ErrAgentShuttingDown
// and register/don't-register correctly in the steady state), but
// TestP1_1_TryAdmitRunWgSerializedAgainstAdmitMu is the actual regression
// test for the race: it proves the mutual-exclusion property the fix
// depends on — that tryAdmitRunWg() cannot proceed while another
// goroutine holds admitMu (i.e. is inside what would be CancelAll's own
// critical section) — which the unsynchronized version does not provide
// at all.
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE (for TestP1_1_TryAdmitRunWgSerializedAgainstAdmitMu):
//  1. In agent.go's tryAdmitRunWg, remove the `a.admitMu.Lock()`/
//     `defer a.admitMu.Unlock()` pair, leaving just the Add/check logic.
//  2. Run: go test ./internal/agent -run TestP1_1_TryAdmitRunWgSerializedAgainstAdmitMu -v
//  3. FAIL: tryAdmitRunWg() returns immediately even while the test holds
//     admitMu locked in the main goroutine — nothing serializes it anymore.
//  4. Restore the admitMu lock/unlock pair inside tryAdmitRunWg.
