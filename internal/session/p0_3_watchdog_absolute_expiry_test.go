// P0-3 regression test (docs/reviews/2026-08-13-release-readiness-static-audit.md):
// the lease watchdog must fire based on the ABSOLUTE lease_expires_at value
// actually committed to the DB, not on "wall-clock time since the last
// successful RenewRunQueueLease call RETURNED".
//
// The bug: RenewRunQueueLease's renewal loop computed
// `newExpiresAt := time.Now().Add(TTL)` BEFORE issuing the DB call, and that
// exact value is what gets written to the row's lease_expires_at on success.
// But the (now-fixed) watchdog used to track `lastSuccessfulRenewal =
// time.Now()` AFTER the call returned, and fire at
// `lastSuccessfulRenewal + TTL - safety_margin`. For a renewal call that
// takes duration D to complete successfully (DB contention, GC pause, disk
// stall), those two timestamps diverge by D. If D exceeds the safety margin,
// the watchdog fires AFTER the row's real DB expiry has already passed —
// during that gap, another pump instance's CleanupExpiredLeases can
// legitimately reclaim the row and dispatch a DUPLICATE execution while this
// executor is still running, believing itself safely within its lease.
//
// The fix: track the absolute lease_expires_at (seeded from the row's
// initial lease returned by LeaseRunQueueEntry, then updated on each
// successful renewal to the exact newExpiresAt value that was just written
// to the DB — never to a post-call time.Now()). The watchdog compares
// wall-clock now() directly against that absolute deadline minus the safety
// margin.
//
// NOTE on timing granularity: lease_expires_at is persisted as UNIX SECONDS
// (RenewRunQueueLease/LeaseRunQueueEntry both call .Unix()), so there is up
// to ~1s of truncation noise between the in-memory floating-point deadline
// and what lands in the DB. The parameters below (TTL=12s, margin=2s,
// artificial renewal delay=4s) are chosen with enough headroom that this
// truncation cannot flip either assertion — see the arithmetic in the doc
// on each constant.
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE:
//  1. In run_queue_pump.go, change the renewal loop's success path back to
//     `leaseExpiresAtAtomic.Store(time.Now().UnixNano())` (post-call time)
//     instead of `time.Unix(newExpiresAt, 0).UnixNano()` (the pre-call value
//     actually written to the DB).
//  2. This test will FAIL: cancellation will be observed AFTER the row's
//     real DB lease_expires_at has already passed, not before it.

// delayedRenewalService wraps session.Service so that:
//   - renewal attempt #1 is delayed by a fixed duration BEFORE forwarding to
//     the real DB call, so it still succeeds (ok=true) but takes
//     artificially long to return — simulating a slow-but-successful
//     RenewRunQueueLease (DB contention, GC pause, disk stall).
//   - every renewal attempt AFTER #1 fails outright (simulating a DB outage
//     that starts right after the one slow success).
//
// This combination is what isolates the bug under test: a successful-but-
// slow renewal must leave the SAME absolute lease_expires_at in the
// watchdog's bookkeeping as what was actually committed to the DB, with no
// later successful renewal around to paper over a wrong value by
// overwriting it again. Without the "everything after #1 fails" half, the
// renewal loop's normal TTL/3 cadence keeps re-renewing successfully every
// tick, and each fresh (fast) success overwrites whatever attempt #1 left
// behind before the watchdog's window has a chance to matter — the bug
// would never be observable from outside the process.

// TestP0_3_WatchdogUsesAbsoluteDBExpiryNotPostCallTime verifies that the
// watchdog cancels execution BEFORE the row's real, DB-committed
// lease_expires_at — even when a successful renewal call is slow enough that
// "time since the call returned" would understate the row's true age by more
// than the safety margin.
//
// Scenario (see arithmetic below; TTL=12s, margin=2s, renewDelay=4s):
//   - Renewal ticks roughly every TTL/3 = 4s.
//   - Renewal attempt #1 (tick at ~4s) is delayed by 4s before hitting the
//     real DB — double the 2s safety margin, and comfortably inside the DB
//     call's own context timeout (computed from the remaining safe lease
//     budget at that tick, ~6s) — so it still succeeds (returns at ~8s)
//     instead of erroring out with a context deadline.
//   - Every renewal attempt AFTER #1 fails outright (simulated DB outage),
//     so no later successful renewal can overwrite what attempt #1 left
//     behind — the tracked deadline stays frozen at exactly attempt #1's
//     result for the rest of the test, isolating its effect.
//   - The real DB row's lease_expires_at after attempt #1 is
//     tickStart + TTL = 4s + 12s = 16s from test start, because newExpiresAt
//     is computed BEFORE the delay/DB call, not after.
//   - With the OLD (buggy) post-call-time watchdog, the tracked deadline
//     would have been computed from time.Now() AFTER the 4s delay:
//     (tickStart + delay) + TTL = 8s + 12s = 20s, giving a fire time of
//     20s - 2s = 18s — AFTER the real DB expiry (16s). That is exactly the
//     unsafe case P0-3 closes: another pump could legitimately reclaim the
//     row via CleanupExpiredLeases and start a duplicate execution up to 2s
//     before the old watchdog would even think it needs to stop.
//   - With the FIXED watchdog, the tracked deadline is tickStart + TTL =
//     4s + 12s = 16s, firing at 16s - 2s = 14s — safely (2s nominal) BEFORE
//     the real DB expiry (16s).
