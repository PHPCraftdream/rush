// P0-4 follow-up (docs/reviews/2026-08-12-post-fix-release-readiness-review.md):
// found during independent zero-trust review of the delegated fix. The
// delegated diff added a cancelable writeCtx/writeCancel pair for the
// checkpoint goroutine's DB write, but stopCheckpoint (the function actually
// called when a turn is ending) never held a reference to writeCancel and
// therefore never called it — the "cancelable context" was cancelable in
// name only. stopCheckpoint's own comment claimed "This allows stopCheckpoint
// to actually cancel an in-flight Update", which was false: writeCancel was
// only ever invoked via `defer writeCancel()` INSIDE the goroutine itself,
// which cannot fire until the goroutine's own blocking Update call already
// returned -- a circular dependency providing zero protection against an
// actual hang. The delegated diff's own regression test for this
// (TestCheckpointContextCancellation_P0_4Regression) was fully vacuous: its
// body contains no assertions or even any function calls, only comments
// describing the mechanism "by code inspection."
//
// Fixed by storing writeCancel on the outer scope (checkpointWriteCancel)
// and having stopCheckpoint call it immediately after signaling stop, before
// waiting out its own 5s grace.
//
// This test proves the fix with a genuinely blocked checkpoint write: a
// message-service wrapper blocks Update calls that carry a Partial finish
// (the checkpoint write's own signature) until either explicitly unblocked
// or its context is cancelled, and records which happened. A model that
// streams some content then pauses mid-turn gives the checkpoint ticker a
// window to fire and get stuck in that blocked Update. CancelAll() is then
// invoked while the write is still genuinely blocked; the test asserts the
// blocked Update's context was cancelled (not that it merely returned
// eventually on its own).
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE:
//  1. In agent.go's stopCheckpoint, remove the `if checkpointWriteCancel !=
//     nil { checkpointWriteCancel() ... }` block.
//  2. Run: go test ./internal/agent -run TestP0_4_StopCheckpointCancelsBlockedWrite -v
//  3. FAIL: the test's wait for ctxCanceledCh times out (5s) because nothing
//     ever cancels writeCtx -- the blocked Update call is only released when
//     this test manually closes releaseCh as a cleanup fallback, proving the
//     write was never actually cancelled by stopCheckpoint.
//  4. Restore the checkpointWriteCancel call.
