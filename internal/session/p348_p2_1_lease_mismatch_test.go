package session

// P2-1 regression test (found in the final @oh review of tasks #337-349,
// 2026-08-10, marked PLAUSIBLE — a genuine race between two concurrent
// pump instances, not reproduced live but confirmed by code inspection):
// processEntry's max-attempts-exhaustion branch leases "the oldest pending
// entry for this session" (LeaseRunQueueEntry does NOT take a specific
// entry ID), then unconditionally terminal-fails (deletes) whatever it got
// leased. If another pump instance had already consumed the
// attempts-exhausted entry between this pump's scan and its own lease
// attempt, THIS lease can land on a completely different, healthy,
// never-executed entry for the same session (e.g. a fresh call queued
// moments after the scan) — and that entry would be silently deleted
// without ever running.
//
// This test exercises processEntry directly (this file lives in package
// session, not session_test, specifically to reach the unexported method)
// with a deliberately mismatched entry ID, deterministically forcing the
// race outcome instead of trying to time two real concurrent pumps against
// each other.
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE:
//  1. In run_queue_pump.go's processEntry, remove the `if leased.ID !=
//     entry.ID { ...; return }` guard (added for this fix) so the code
//     falls through directly to TerminalFailRunQueueEntry(leased.ID)
//     unconditionally, as it did before.
//  2. Run: go test ./internal/session -run TestReleaseGate_P2_1_LeaseMismatchDoesNotDeleteWrongEntry -v
//  3. FAIL: the healthy, never-executed entry is deleted (terminal-failed)
//     even though processEntry was only supposed to be terminal-failing
//     the OTHER (attempts-exhausted) entry.
//  4. Restore the guard and PASS.
