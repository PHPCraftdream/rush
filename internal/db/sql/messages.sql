-- points at between two separate calls of this query. This query remains here
-- as the plain, unprotected primitive; message.Service.ListPaginatedSnapshot
-- is the race-free caller-facing wrapper read_delegation_transcript.go
-- actually uses, built from GetTranscriptWindowCursor (pins one consistent
-- snapshot boundary) plus the keyset pair ListMessagesBySessionOlderThan-
-- CreatedAt / ListMessagesBySessionAtCreatedAt (fetches the window strictly

-- Returns, in a SINGLE round trip, the (created_at, rowid) of the row at

-- with the session's total message count as of that same statement
-- execution (SQLite evaluates COUNT(*) OVER() over the full WHERE-matched row
-- set before LIMIT/OFFSET are applied, in the same query plan as the LIMIT 1
-- OFFSET ? row selection - both numbers come from one consistent snapshot).
--
-- This is the fix for the cross-statement race in read_delegation_transcript.go:
-- previously Count() and ListPaginated() were two independent queries, so a
-- message inserted between them (the normal case while observing a live
-- sub-agent) could make the total and the offset-derived window disagree.
-- message.Service.ListPaginatedSnapshot calls this query FIRST to pin down a
-- single high-water-mark snapshot (the boundary row's created_at/row_id, plus
-- total), then fetches the window strictly at-or-before that boundary via
-- ListMessagesBySessionOlderThanCreatedAt + ListMessagesBySessionAtCreatedAt.
-- Any message inserted after this query executes is newer than the pinned
-- boundary and is therefore correctly excluded from both the "total" figure
-- and the follow-up window fetch - the read as a whole reflects one
-- consistent point in time rather than drifting across separate round trips.
--
-- created_at/row_id are NULL when offset falls at or past the end of the
-- session's messages (i.e. there is no row at that position): callers must
-- treat NULL as "start of history", matching offset's existing clamp-to-empty
-- behavior in clampTranscriptWindow.
--
-- row_id is exposed via CAST(rowid AS INTEGER): sqlc's SQLite catalog has no
-- notion of SQLite's implicit rowid column outside ORDER BY (confirmed by
-- hand: any bare `rowid` reference in a WHERE clause or plain SELECT-list
-- position fails static analysis with "column \"rowid\" does not exist",
-- while the identical reference wrapped in CAST(... AS INTEGER) in the
-- SELECT list is accepted) - see ListMessagesBySessionOlderThanCreatedAt's
-- comment for why the keyset filter itself therefore avoids rowid in a WHERE
-- clause entirely rather than fighting this further.

-- WHERE clause - see GetTranscriptWindowCursor's comment for why that's
-- avoided. Because the boundary is a concrete value pinned by
-- GetTranscriptWindowCursor at the start of the read (not "the Nth row from
-- the current end"), inserting new messages at the head between calls can
-- never shift which rows this query returns: the boundary itself doesn't move.
