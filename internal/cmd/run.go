var runCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Aliases: []string{"r"},
	Use:     "run [prompt...]",
	Short:   "Run a single non-interactive prompt",
	Long: `Run a single prompt in non-interactive mode and exit.

  WARNING — auto-bypass of inner CLI permissions:
  ` + "`crush run`" + ` is non-interactive by design (no human at the keyboard),
  so any inner CLI sub-process it spawns (claude / codex / gemini) is
  launched with its own bypass-permissions flag (claude
  --dangerously-skip-permissions, codex --approval-mode yolo, gemini
  --yolo). The sub-process can read, write, and execute anywhere the
  invoking user has permission. There is no per-tool confirmation. Use
  ` + "`crush run`" + ` only in workspaces you can afford to lose; if you need
  real isolation, wrap the invocation in an OS-level sandbox (Sandboxie
  Plus, Windows Sandbox, WSL2 + landlock, Docker, etc.). Interactive
  sessions (TUI / web) keep the normal permission flow — this WARNING
  applies only to ` + "`crush run`" + `.

--role is REQUIRED: every invocation must declare which model slot it
wants. This avoids silently burning premium tokens on a one-liner.
Four roles exist:
  smart | large      the strong default slot (top-level agent runs here)
  fast  | small      the cheap slot, for trivial work
  worker             optional, no alias; cheap slot for delegated
                      hands-on sub-task work. Never auto-selected — only
                      reachable via --role worker directly, OR indirectly
                      when a worker model is configured and this run uses
                      --role smart: sub-agents spawned by the "agent" tool
                      then run on worker, get a work-capable toolset
                      (edit/multiedit/write/bash/todos/download/fetch/
                      ask_question), and the default sub-agent ban below
                      is lifted so the orchestrator can delegate at all —
                      even against an explicit --agents single, since a
                      configured worker means delegation is the intent.
                      The smart agent's system prompt also gains an
                      "Orchestrator mode" nudge to delegate in context-sized chunks
                      instead of implementing inline.
  reviewer           optional, no alias; the strongest slot, for explicit
                      review invocations. Never auto-selected anywhere —
                      reachable only via --role reviewer.
worker/reviewer are configured with "crush models use <smart> <fast>
--worker <model> --reviewer <model>" (or the web UI / crush.json's
models.worker / models.reviewer directly). The actual model id behind
each role comes from "crush models show"; --model overrides it for one
invocation.

Prompt sources (combined as "<stdin>\n\n<args>"):
  - positional args:   crush run "your prompt"
  - stdin pipe/redir:  echo "hello" | crush run     |     crush run < prompt.md
  - both (stdin = context, args = question)

Sessions: --session takes either an existing session id (or hash prefix)
to continue, OR an arbitrary new id to start a fresh session with that
exact id — handy for CI where the build matrix maps to a stable key.

System prompt: --system-prompt / --system-prompt-file persists the prompt
on the session so subsequent runs with the same --session pick it up.
If neither is passed and .crush/system-prompts/default.md exists, it is
loaded automatically (see "crush claude-init" for a starter template).

Session title: if the session title is empty or "Untitled Session", the
first 60 characters of the user prompt are used as the title. This makes
"sessions list" immediately useful without a --title flag.

Budget persistence: --max-cost, --max-tokens, and --timeout values are
saved on the session row. "sessions show" displays cost vs budget, and
"sessions locks" shows an ELAPSED / BUDGET column. ended_reason is set
when the run finishes (done, canceled, timeout, max_cost, max_tokens,
error) and appears in "sessions show" and "sessions list --json".

Output modes (mutually exclusive --stream / --json):
  - default (terse): tool-call names on stderr as "▶ <toolName>"; only
    the final assistant message on stdout.
  - --stream:        every assistant token streamed live to stdout.
  - --json:          a single JSON object on stdout when the run ends —
                     {session_id, exit_reason, final_text, assistant_notes,
                      tool_calls, usage, duration_ms, error}. Tool-call
                     heartbeat still goes to stderr so wrappers can show
                     progress.

Shaping the model's output:
  --format <preset|string>  Appends an in-prompt hint that asks the model
                            to produce a specific shape for this turn
                            only (not persisted). Presets:
                              json              -> final answer is one
                                                   raw JSON value, no
                                                   fence, no prose.
                              json-schema:<f>   -> same + conform to <f>.
                              @<file>           -> use <file> contents
                                                   verbatim as the hint.
                              <any other text>  -> freeform "Output
                                                   format: ..." instruction.
                            With --json or --format json, the envelope's
                            final_text is also post-processed: a
                            triple-backtick "json" fence and prose
                            preamble/suffix are stripped so
                            "jq .final_text" works directly. The
                            original (unstripped) text is preserved in
                            envelope.assistant_notes when stripping ran.

Sub-agent policy:
  --agents <single|with-agents|agent-allow>
                            (unset)       -- DEFAULT. No sub-agents: the
                                             "agent" and "agentic_fetch"
                                             tools are removed from the
                                             toolset for this run. A
                                             non-interactive run has no UI
                                             to surface sub-agent work and a
                                             nested run burns tokens out of
                                             view (and risks recursion), so
                                             the model EXECUTES instead of
                                             re-delegating.
                            single        -- same as the default, explicit.
                                             Still yields to a configured
                                             Worker model under --role smart
                                             (see "worker" above) — a
                                             configured worker means
                                             delegation is the intent.
                            agent-allow   -- opt in: tools present, the
                                             model decides whether to use
                                             them.
                            with-agents   -- opt in + nudge the model to fan
                                             out via the "agent" tool when
                                             work is decomposable.

Sub-agent aggregation (only matters when --agents permits fan-out):
  --aggregation <summary|concat|attach>
                            summary  -- default. Parent composes a
                                        wrap-up; sub-agent detail lives
                                        only in the DB. Easy on the
                                        envelope, can lose information.
                            concat   -- prompt-nudge asks the parent to
                                        include each sub-agent's reply
                                        verbatim in final_text. Bigger
                                        final_text but no detail lost.
                            attach   -- each sub-agent's last assistant
                                        text is collected into the
                                        envelope's sub_agent_outputs
                                        array; final_text becomes a
                                        brief wrap-up. Best for
                                        machine consumers that want the
                                        structured set.
                            A reduction-loss warning ALWAYS fires in
                            envelope.warnings when parent collapses
                            sub-agent outputs to <40% of their combined
                            character count.

Use --timeout to bound the run from outside (the agent gets a clean
cancel + the partial answer is preserved in the session and is included
in --json output). Plain numbers are treated as seconds: --timeout 900
is the same as --timeout 900s or --timeout 15m.

Runaway protection:
  --max-cost 0.50     abort when session cost (USD) crosses the threshold
  --max-tokens 100k   abort when prompt+completion tokens cross the limit
                      (supports k/M suffixes: 100k = 100000, 1M = 1000000)
  Both checks fire after each agent step. The session is saved with its
  partial work so you can inspect or fork from it.
  Even with --timeout 0 (no graceful deadline), a 6h default hard wall-clock
  backstop force-kills a true zombie (deadlock / a read that ignores ctx).
  Override via CRUSH_RUN_DEFAULT_HARD_TIMEOUT (plain number = seconds, or a
  Go duration like 30m/2h; invalid/non-positive falls back to the 6h default).

Peak-hours override:
  --allow-peak-hours  bypass a provider's configured peak_hours refusal for
                      this single invocation. No persistent config-level
                      equivalent exists; the override is conscious and
                      one-off by design.
                      WARNING: this flag must NEVER be added by an
                      orchestrating agent on its own initiative. Only pass
                      --allow-peak-hours when a human operator has explicitly
                      asked, in this specific request, to override peak hours.
                      An agent that adds this flag without an explicit human
                      instruction is violating the operator's intent.

Lifecycle hooks:
  --on-finish "cmd"   run a shell command after the agent finishes.
                      Env vars set: CRUSH_SESSION_ID, CRUSH_EXIT_REASON,
                      CRUSH_COST_USD, CRUSH_TOKENS, CRUSH_DURATION_SEC.

External cancellation: use "crush sessions cancel <id>" from another
terminal to set a DB flag; the running agent checks it after each step
and stops gracefully.

Permissions: non-interactive runs auto-approve every permission request
(no one is on the keyboard to confirm). The agent gets the full tool
set with no prompting. This is fast but irreversible — only run
"crush run" in a workspace whose contents you can afford to lose, and
prefer --cwd /some/sandbox-or-temp-dir for one-shot scripts.

Restricted-run allowlist (scoped permissions):
  --restrict-run           flip from auto-approve-everything to
                           deny-by-default; only allowlist matches are
                           approved. Also armed by setting
                           permissions.run.restrict=true in crush.json.
  --allow-bash '<pattern>' permit a bash command in restricted mode
                           (repeatable). Forms:
                             cmd args    word-boundary prefix
                                         (e.g. 'git diff' matches
                                         'git diff HEAD~1' but refuses
                                         'ls && rm -rf /')
                             exact:cmd   whole-string equality
                             glob:pat    filepath.Match glob
                             regex:pat   regexp on the command
  --allow-tool '<name>'    permit a non-bash tool or tool:action in
                           restricted mode (repeatable). e.g. 'view' or
                           'edit:write'. NOTE: 'bash' / 'bash:execute'
                           are ignored here — use --allow-bash for
                           command-level control of the bash tool.

  Config equivalent (crush.json):
    "permissions": {
      "run": {
        "restrict": true,
        "allow_tools": ["view"],
        "allow_bash": ["git diff", "glob:ls *"]
      }
    }
  CLI flags merge with config (union); --restrict-run forces restrict on.
  Precedence: permissions.allowed_tools is a global bypass that still
  wins over both lists (it is checked before the gate). Listing 'bash'
  there approves EVERY bash command; for command-level control, leave
  allowed_tools empty for bash and use --allow-bash / run.allow_bash.
  Restricted mode never affects interactive TUI / web sessions.

Protecting harness-owned files: when the orchestrator pipes "crush run"
output through a shell redirect, the model can pick the same path for
its write/edit tool (e.g. it sees ".tmp-audit-D.json" in the prompt
and decides "I'll just write findings there directly"). Result: a
mixed file where envelope and tool output overwrite each other in
non-deterministic order. To block this set the CRUSH_FORBID_WRITES
env-var to a comma-separated list of paths the write/edit/multiedit
tools must NOT touch. Example:

  out=/tmp/audit.json
  CRUSH_FORBID_WRITES="$out" \
    crush run --json --format json ... > "$out" 2>"$out.err"

The tools fail with a visible error to the model when a forbidden path
is targeted; the model then either retries with a different path or
falls back to returning the content via final_text — both of which
keep the redirect target intact.`,
