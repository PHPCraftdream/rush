// Tree teardown on Unix needs no per-process registration for the ORDINARY
// paths: KillProcess detects process-group leaders via getpgid and kills the
// whole group, and leaderhood is a spawn-time attribute the spawning code
// sets (SysProcAttr.Setpgid), not something retrofittable onto a running pid.
//
// The registry below exists for the one case those paths cannot cover: a
// rush that dies without running its own cleanup. Windows gets that for
// free — its Job Object is kill-on-close, so the OS tears the tree down when
// the process takes the last handle with it. Unix has no equivalent, and
// since CLI children were moved into their own process groups they are no
// longer in the terminal's foreground group either, so a Ctrl-C the terminal
// delivers to that group no longer reaches them.
//
// Measured on Ubuntu 24.04, with the parent catching SIGINT in-process so
// children inherit the default disposition, and liveness decided by Wait()
// returning rather than by kill(pid, 0) — which succeeds for a zombie and
// made two earlier attempts at this measurement read backwards:
//
//	Setpgid=false  child pgid == parent pgid  ->  SIGINT to parent group: child DIED
//	Setpgid=true   child pgid != parent pgid  ->  SIGINT to parent group: child SURVIVED
//
// So the registry records which groups this process is responsible for, and
// KillAllTrackedTrees is the sweep a last-resort signal handler runs before
// exiting.

// numeric id — the same hazard KillProcess guards against with its own
