var sessionsWatchCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "watch [session-id]",
	Short: "Pick a session (or take one by id) and live-tail it until it ends",
	Long: `One-stop "open a live view of a session" command.

Without arguments: shows an interactive picker (arrow keys, Enter to
select) and then drops into live-tail of the chosen session. The picker
shows the 15 most recently active sessions and a "(+N not shown)"
footer when there are older ones — use "rush sessions list" to see
every session.

With a <session-id> argument: skips the picker and live-tails that
session directly. Short hashes (the HASH column of "sessions list")
are accepted.

Live-tail prints every existing message in the session, then polls
every --interval (default 1s) for new messages and prints them as they
arrive. The loop exits automatically when the session ends — detected
via any of:
  (a) the session row has an ended_reason
  (b) the lock file disappears (process exited / was killed)
  (c) the latest assistant message has a non-partial Finish part

On exit a summary block is printed: id, title, end reason, duration,
tokens (prompt + completion) and cost (with budget if one was set).

Ctrl+C interrupts and prints "(interrupted — session still running)"
without a summary so you don't mistake "I stopped watching" for
"the session ended".`,
	Example: `
# Pick a session interactively and live-tail it
rush sessions watch

# Live-tail a specific session (full id or short hash)
rush sessions watch abc123

# Faster polling for snappier output
rush sessions watch --interval 500ms
