// TestP1_5_GenerationCheckPreventsMetadataClobber verifies that a stale
// cleanup goroutine from a prior release does NOT clobber a new owner's
// metadata. This is the fix for P1-5 from the 2026-08-11 review.
//
// The test forces the clobber scenario by:
//  1. Injecting a cleanup function for the first holder that blocks on a
//     channel instead of a fixed sleep (see proceedCleanup below).
//  2. Releasing the first holder (returns quickly due to
//     releaseMetadataCleanupBound, but cleanup is still blocked).
//  3. Acquiring a second holder (succeeds since the OS lock is already
//     free) and confirming its generation differs from the first.
//  4. ONLY THEN unblocking the first cleanup goroutine, deterministically
//     guaranteeing it observes the second owner's already-written
//     generation sidecar no matter how slow the machine is.
//  5. Verifying that the second holder's PID/generation are NOT clobbered.
//
// A fixed time.Sleep(100ms) was used here originally, on the assumption
// that acquiring the second lock and writing its generation sidecar would
// always finish well within that window. That assumption broke on CI
// (ubuntu-latest, `go test -race`): the added race-detector overhead
// occasionally pushed the second acquire's own file I/O past the 100ms
// mark, so the stale cleanup's generation-sidecar read raced ahead of the
// second owner's write and legitimately saw only the first owner's
// generation still on disk — reproducing the fix's own documented,
// accepted residual TOCTOU gap (see clearHolderMetadata's doc comment)
// rather than exposing an actual defect in the fix. The channel gate
// below removes that race entirely: the stale cleanup cannot even begin
// its generation-sidecar read until the test has already confirmed the
// second owner's generation is on disk and different from the first.
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE:
//  1. Temporarily disable the generation check in clearHolderMetadata by
//     commenting out the currentGen != expectedGeneration early return.
//  2. Run: go test ./internal/session -run TestP1_5_GenerationCheckPreventsMetadataClobber -v
//  3. The test will FAIL because the first cleanup clobbers the second owner's metadata.
//  4. Restore the generation check and the test will PASS.

// turns an occasional, harmless write hiccup into a PID that never clears
// on release again — worse than the narrow clobber window P1-5 exists to
// close, and a regression from the pre-fix unconditional-cleanup
// behavior. Fixed clearHolderMetadata to only skip on a POSITIVE
