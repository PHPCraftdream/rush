	// orchestrator fanning work out to sub-agents while a 17-minute gate ran
	// hit the cap, the session died on "maximum number of background jobs
	// (50) reached", and the operator's next brief told the model to stop
	// delegating altogether. The cap cost a whole workflow.
	//
	// The default stays at 50 anyway, and the reason is measured rather than
	// cautious: raising it to 500 (and then 200) made the test suite itself
	// unstable on a developer machine — internal/shell went from 5s to 149s
	// and timing-sensitive siblings like
	// TestBashTool_CtxCancelWaitsForConfirmedProcessKill began failing,
	// because the jobs a higher cap admits are real processes competing for
	// the same machine. A default that destabilises the suite would
	// destabilise a busy agent host the same way.
	//
	// So the limit is now the operator's to raise, deliberately, on a
	// machine they know can take it — and the warning below tells them when
	// they are approaching it instead of letting the run die at the wall.

	// much shorter than CompletedJobRetentionMinutes: the buffered bytes are
	// the expensive part (up to 2*maxStreamBufferBytes per job) and are only

// resident until CompletedJobRetentionMinutes purges it via Cleanup, which the
// bash tool invokes at the start of every run. The time-based retention
// already bounds how long completed jobs linger, and even thousands of them
// amount to only a few MiB of metadata; a separate count-based eviction would
// add a tuning knob and a "which completed job to drop first" policy for
// negligible gain. The concurrency limit (MaxBackgroundJobs) is enforced on

// bufferRetention is the duration after completion before a job's buffered
// stdout/stderr bytes are released via a one-shot time.AfterFunc armed in

// override it to a short duration to exercise the timer path without waiting
// 15 minutes.

// Deliberately NOT t.Setenv-style scoped: it's a plain package-level var
// mutated directly (e.g. `bufferRetention = 50 * time.Millisecond`) by tests

// long as no test overriding it ever runs under t.Parallel() — see the
// identical warning on isolatedModelsEnv in internal/cmd/models_use_test.go
// and on TestIsWSLLauncher_FallsBackWhenSystemRootUnset in
