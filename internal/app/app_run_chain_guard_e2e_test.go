// The reaction chain guard (#1113), end to end through the real `rush run`
// loop (design test 6): the first turn launches a HELD background job W plus
// two timers whose completions open the poll legs, and the model reacts to
// each timer's completion with a Drain leg that polls for W with a pure wait
// command (`echo tick-N`). While W is the session's own undelivered work the
// in-turn progress guard (§2.2 of
// docs/plans/2026-10-01-in-turn-progress-guard.md) refuses every one of
// those launches at once -- no workLedger.Start, no durable row in either
// authority, no #1113 claim
// -- so a leg that carries neither a claim nor progress is invisible to
// chainLink: no reaction chain forms, the "reaction chain stopped" line never
// appears, and the loop simply keeps waiting on W. Releasing W (once both
// legs are served) produces exactly one more Drain -- a real fact -- whose
// answer ends the run. The second test in this file keeps the old shape with
// no W at all: there the sleeps really run (ownWork is false and a leg's
// streak never reaches S), #1113 counts three links and stops the chain.
//
// ALL THREE commands -- W, timer 1, timer 2 -- are sentinel-held from the
// launch: none can complete until the fixture writes its release file, and
// each release file is written only after the provider handler has SERVED
// the request that the staging depends on. Staging by wall-clock stagger
// (`sleep 4` / `sleep 8`) plus a request-count release was the original
// defect: batch bash has a REAL 3s inline window (batch_delivery.go's
// deliverWithEscapeWindow, wired in batch_install_tools.go), the calls of
// one assistant message run sequentially, and production pulls completion
// notices before EVERY provider step (agent_turn_step.go's PrepareStep), so
// a time-based timer could complete while the launch turn's closing request
// was being prepared; that request answered unconditionally, the pull marked
// the completion reacted, and the counted request was never created -- the
// 90s deadline of shadow-pp-118511110443, reached before the retained
// no-root oracle ever ran.
//
// The provider handler is a phase machine whose every step routes on what
// the CURRENT request actually contains -- its LAST user message and its
// LAST tool result, never concatenated history, so each phase proves the
// intended completion was consumed in THIS request:
//
//	close (request 2): the launch turn's closing step. Its last user
//	  message must carry NO completion marker at all -- every job is still
//	  held, so a marker here would mean a held job completed unaided, a
//	  fixture violation. Served => release TIMER 1.
//	leg1-open:  last user message carries CG-TICK-1 => emit the refused poll.
//	leg1-close: last tool result is the executed "tick-1" (batch mode: the
//	  guard's own-work half is ledger-blind, finding 4 in
//	  .rush/stdin/jb-f6a3.findings.md) or the guard's refusal text (legacy)
//	  => "waiting 1"; release TIMER 2.
//	leg2-open:  last user message carries CG-TICK-2 => emit the refused poll.
//	leg2-close: last tool result is "tick-2" or the refusal => "waiting 2";
//	  release W.
//	final:      last user message carries W-DONE => "final answer".
//
// Invariant making this deterministic: at most ONE job is un-held at any
// moment (each release happens in the handler after serving the preceding
// phase's request), so the marker in the request's LAST user message
// uniquely identifies the expected completion; any other shape fails fast
// with t.Errorf and a 400 -- never a silent wait.
//
// Revert-check: dropping ownWork from refuseWait (turn_progress_guard.go)
// lets the echo legs through in legacy mode -- each starts an async job
// whose completion arrives as a USER notice carrying "tick-1"/"tick-2",
// which no closing phase accepts (a closing step only reads a TOOL result
// or a refusal), so the provider answers 400 and the test goes red. The
// hard ctx deadline plus the provider's 400 guarantee the test fails rather
// than hangs.
