# CHANGELOG.fork.md

This document tracks every divergence between this fork and upstream
`charmbracelet/crush`. Its purpose is **not** to be a release changelog
for end users — it is a survival guide for the next person (likely
ourselves) who has to merge upstream `main` into the fork and decide,
file by file, which side to keep.

When you finish a merge, append a new entry to the **Chronological
commit log** section at the bottom. When you make a non-obvious patch to
an upstream file, leave a `// Fork patch:` comment in the code pointing
back here.

## 1. Why this fork exists

Upstream Crush is a **terminal UI** (TUI) coding agent — built around
a human typing into a terminal session. The optional `client/server`
mode in upstream still drives the TUI; its REST API under `/v1/...` is
just a transport between the TUI front-end (running in a separate
terminal) and the agent back-end (Unix socket / Windows named pipe).

This fork has a fundamentally different goal: **make `crush` a tool
that other AI agents can drive.** The primary user is not a human at
a keyboard — it is an orchestrator (Claude Code, a custom LLM wrapper,
a CI job, a multi-agent fleet) that spawns `crush run` and parses the
JSON envelope on stdout. A React/Tailwind web UI stays for the cases
where a human DOES want to peek in, but the design centre is the CLI
and the orchestrator-facing contract.

Concretely, this single repositioning forces everything that follows:

- The TUI is removed because the primary user no longer types.
- `crush run` grows a wrapper-stable JSON envelope, a frozen set of
  flags (`--role`, `--session`, `--format`, `--agents`, `--timeout`,
  `--json`, `--stream`), and post-validation guarantees so a script
  on top can branch deterministically on the result.
- Multiple concurrent `crush run` against one repo become a supported
  scenario (multi-section audits, fan-out refactors) — so the storage
  layer, lock files, log writes and MCP-id files all get hardened
  against process races.
- Errors are honest: when the model breaks its contract (invalid JSON,
  context overflow, mid-stream stall, sub-agent fan-out without a
  final composition) the envelope says so. The agent on top cannot
  read minds; silent success is the worst class of failure.
- Bootstrap helpers (`crush claude-init`) drop a delegation guide into
  the workspace so an upper LLM learns the rules of engagement
  without trial-and-error.

Everything we kept, removed, or rewrote — including the React web UI,
the persistent SQLite-backed sessions, the cross-process file locks,
the additive cost SQL — follows from "be a good tool for an agent on
top".

### High-level differences from upstream

| Area | Upstream | This fork |
| ---- | -------- | --------- |
| Front-end | Bubble Tea TUI (`internal/ui/`, ~495 files) | React SPA (`web/`, embedded via `go:embed`) |
| Transport | REST `/v1/...` over Unix socket / Windows named pipe (`internal/server/proto.go`, 30KB) | WebSocket `/ws` over TCP loopback (`internal/server/handlers.go`, ~58 handlers) |
| Auth | None (local-socket trust) | Token-based, see `internal/server/auth.go` |
| Workspace model | `internal/workspace/` abstraction (single local vs. remote-HTTP impl behind `CRUSH_CLIENT_SERVER` env) | Single embedded `appPkg.App`; no abstraction (workspace package removed) |
| Sessions | One model per agent role, set globally | Per-session model overrides stored in DB (migration `20260308000001`) |
| Permissions | In-memory rules during a TUI run | Persistent per-session rules in DB (migration `20260308000002`) |
| Skills | TUI list dialog | `web/` slash-command autocomplete + browser dialog |
| CLI providers | `internal/agent/cliprovider/` is upstream too but limited | Heavily extended: `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, Gemini/Codex CLIs, MCP bridge, session resume for prompt caching |

### Things we are NOT doing

- We do not implement upstream's REST `/v1/...` API. The fork's
  WebSocket protocol is not wire-compatible with it. A future migration
  is technically possible (see prior analysis in commit history), but
  not planned — the WebSocket is fine.
- We do not ship the TUI. Any merge conflict that resurrects
  `internal/ui/<anything-but-notification>` should be resolved by
  deleting the file on our side.
- We do not preserve `flake.nix` / `.envrc` / Hyper subscription paths
  from upstream — see Section 3.

## 2. Merge guidance — how to resolve conflicts from upstream

### Default rule — auto-reject all upstream TUI / client-server features

**Anything upstream adds that exists to serve their TUI or their
client-server REST architecture is rejected without discussion.** This
is the fork's core posture, not a per-merge judgement call. Do not stop
to ask the user about TUI/CS additions — they have made this decision
once and it is permanent. Concrete patterns:

- New `internal/ui/*` files (pills, picker, scrollbar, sidebar,
  notifications widget, mark/marker UI markers, etc.) — `git rm`.
- New `internal/backend/*`, `internal/client/*`, `internal/workspace/*`,
  `internal/cmd/server*.go`, `internal/cmd/session.go`,
  `internal/cmd/logout.go` — `git rm`.
- New REST proto types in `internal/server/proto.go` or new
  `internal/proto/*.go` files specifically wired to client-server
  (e.g. `proto/skills.go` shipping `SkillsEvent`) — `git rm`.
- New backend abstractions like `skills.Manager`, `skills.Catalog`,
  `workspace.AppWorkspace`, anything with `WithGlobalMirror` /
  cross-client RPC plumbing — `git rm` (the entire file/type).
- Auto-merged callsites of such removed types (e.g. `app.Skills` field,
  `skillsMgr` parameter, `s.applyEstimatedUsageState(...)`) — surgically
  removed from our existing files. Auto-merge will silently leave these
  in: search with `grep -rn '<removed-type-or-method>' internal/` after
  every merge and clean them up.
- New `setupEvents()` / `setupSubscriber()` style helpers that bridge
  service brokers into a `tea.Msg` pubsub for bubbletea — drop the whole
  block. Our WebSocket hub (`internal/server/hub.go`) handles fan-out
  directly without going through tea.Msg.
- TUI-driven backend fields like `Session.EstimatedUsage`,
  `service.estimatedUsageMu`/`estimatedUsage` map and their setter
  methods — drop entirely. The marker feature serves a TUI widget we do
  not ship; the WebUI computes usage display from the event stream.

If a *behavioural fix* arrives that happens to be packaged with TUI
code (e.g. a `fix(ui): ...` commit that incidentally touches a session
service), extract only the non-UI part and apply it manually — do not
take the wrapper. The upstream UI infrastructure has zero callers in
our fork's WebSocket+React surface, so any of it linked in becomes
dead-but-compiled code that drags in bubbletea/lipgloss/fang.

The narrow exception is `internal/ui/notification/` — OS-native
notifications (Windows toast, macOS NotificationCenter, Linux libnotify)
that the web server reuses to surface re-auth / out-of-credits events.

### Per-file conflict table

When you run `git merge origin/main` and get conflicts, the table below
tells you which side is authoritative for each common conflict class.

| Conflict pattern | Side to keep | Why |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --- |
| `internal/ui/anim/`, `internal/ui/chat/`, `internal/ui/common/`, `internal/ui/completions/`, `internal/ui/dialog/`, `internal/ui/list/`, `internal/ui/logo/`, `internal/ui/model/`, `internal/ui/styles/` (DU — we deleted, they modified) | **Delete** (`git rm`) | TUI was removed in `7ff2292e`. Resurrecting any of it pulls in a tree of bubbletea/lipgloss imports our `cmd/web` doesn't use. |
| `internal/ui/notification/` | **Keep** | OS-native notifications are reused by the web server. |
| `internal/backend/` (DU) | **Delete** | Upstream's split between agent core (`backend`) and TUI was meant for the client/server mode. We have a single embedded `appPkg.App` in `internal/app/` so there is no need for the split. |
| `internal/client/` (DU) | **Delete** | HTTP REST client for upstream's client/server mode. Our front-end is the browser, not Go. |
| `internal/cmd/server.go`, `internal/cmd/server_*.go`, `internal/cmd/session.go`, `internal/cmd/logout.go`, `internal/cmd/clientserverrace/` (DU) | **Delete** | Upstream client/server CLI subcommands. Our subcommand is `crush web` (see `internal/cmd/web.go`). |
| `internal/server/proto.go`, `internal/server/config.go`, `internal/server/logging.go`, `internal/server/net_*.go` (DU) | **Delete** | Upstream's REST `/v1/...` server. Our server is `internal/server/{server,handlers,protocol,events,hub,auth,wire}.go` and lives next to them. |
| `internal/workspace/` (DU) | **Decide each merge.** Last time (commit `8b30fad1`'s merge resolution) we silently dropped it. Currently we don't import the package anywhere, so the build passes either way. If upstream starts hardening the abstraction in a way we want to inherit, restore it — otherwise leave deleted. Document the decision in the commit message. |
| `go.mod` / `go.sum` (UU) | **Merge both sides.** Take upstream's version bumps but keep our additions: `@rsbuild/plugin-babel`-related Go deps are none (frontend-only), but anything we added for the web server (websocket/cors/etc) must stay. Run `go mod tidy` after resolving. |
| `internal/cmd/root.go` (UU) | **Keep ours but pull in their new flags.** We register `crush web` as the default subcommand; upstream registers `tui`. Diff carefully and copy over only flag additions. |
| `internal/cmd/login.go` (UU) | **Keep ours.** Our flow stores tokens for the web server; upstream's writes to the TUI auth context. |
| `internal/agent/agent.go` (UU) | **Merge by hand.** This is our main extension point: sliding context window, queued compact, silent background compaction, empty-response detection (see Section 4.A). Upstream evolves this file too. Take each new upstream change as a separate patch and verify our `// Fork patch:` blocks still apply. |
| `internal/agent/coordinator.go` (UU) | **Merge by hand.** We added `TakeSummarizeQueue`, `RunWithOverrides`, and per-session yolo/permission tracking. Upstream's coordinator drives one TUI session at a time, ours drives N concurrent web sessions. |
| `internal/message/message.go`, `internal/message/content.go` (UU) | **Merge by hand.** We added fields `Pinned`, `Hidden`, `ReasoningEffort` (with DB migrations). Keep both sides' new fields; matching DB migrations live in `internal/db/migrations/20260*`. |
| `internal/permission/permission.go` (UU) | **Merge by hand.** We persist permissions per-session in the DB. Upstream keeps them in memory. Our persistence layer must survive any refactor. |
| `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/config/load.go`, `internal/config/store.go` (UU) | **Merge by hand.** Our `Hooks` configuration block must remain (see `docs/hooks/README.md`). |
| `internal/version/version.go` (UU) | **Merge by hand.** Take their version bump, keep our git-info exposure if changed. |
| Any new `internal/proto/*.go` from upstream (added/modified) | **Keep upstream.** This is the new typed wire protocol they introduced; we do not use it yet but it is read-only types — leaving it in does not hurt and lets us adopt it incrementally. |

When in doubt: **prefer keeping our side** for anything that wires into
the WebSocket server or the React UI; **prefer upstream's side** for
anything in `internal/agent/tools/*` (tool implementations), provider
catalogs (`internal/agent/hyper/`), and `schema.json` (JSON-schema for
config). The latter we want to track upstream as closely as possible
so users' editor configs keep working.

## 3. What was removed from upstream

Removals fall into five buckets. The bucket is the reason we removed
them, not the file type.

### 3.A — TUI (~495 files in `internal/ui/`)
Replaced by `web/` (React + Tailwind, embedded with `go:embed all:dist`
from `web/embed.go`). Initial removal in `7ff2292e`.

The only `internal/ui/` directory we kept is `internal/ui/notification/`
— it implements OS-native notifications (Windows toast / macOS
NotificationCenter / Linux libnotify) and is reused by the web server
to surface re-auth and out-of-credits events to the user.

### 3.B — Upstream's client/server REST layer
- `internal/server/proto.go` (REST `/v1/...` handlers — ~30KB)
- `internal/server/config.go`, `internal/server/logging.go`,
  `internal/server/net_other.go`, `internal/server/net_windows.go`
- `internal/client/` (Go client of the REST API)
- `internal/cmd/server.go`, `internal/cmd/server_other.go`,
  `internal/cmd/server_windows.go` (CLI plumbing)
- `internal/cmd/session.go`, `internal/cmd/clientserverrace/`,
  `internal/cmd/spawnlock_*.go` (TUI ↔ daemon coordination)

Our replacement: `internal/server/{server,handlers,protocol,events,
hub,auth,wire}.go` — a WebSocket server with token auth, mounted at
`/ws` with the React bundle served at `/`.

### 3.C — `internal/backend/` package
Upstream split agent-core (`backend/`) and TUI-front (`ui/`) so the
client/server mode could plug HTTP between them. We embed everything in
one process under `internal/app/App`, so the split is unnecessary churn.

Removed files: `agent.go`, `backend.go`, `config.go`, `events.go`,
`filetracker.go`, `permission.go`, `session.go`, `util.go`.

### 3.D — `internal/cmd/logout.go` + `login_test.go`
Upstream's logout was tied to its OAuth-for-Hyper flow with on-disk
credential cache files. We removed the subcommand because the web UI
handles provider credentials directly (Settings → Providers). The
underlying `internal/oauth/` packages stay — we just don't expose a
shell-level logout command.

### 3.E — Telemetry / metadata files
- `flake.nix`, `flake.lock`, `.envrc` — Nix dev environment we don't
  use on Windows.
- `INVESTIGATION.md` was upstream's pre-release notes — replaced by
  this document.
- A handful of `*.md.tpl` files were renamed back to `*.md` because we
  removed the templating step that upstream introduced and never used.

## 4. What was added in this fork

Topical groups (not chronological — see Section 6 for that).

### 4.A — WebSocket server (`internal/server/`)

Files added (all new — none from upstream):

| File | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| `server.go` | HTTP mux: `/auth`, `/auth/check`, `/ws`, `/` (SPA). Token auth. CORS for local dev. |
| `handlers.go` | 58 `handleXxx(ctx, a *App, c *Client, msg WSMessage)` handlers — one per WS message type. The fork's actual API surface. |
| `protocol.go` | WS message type names + payload structs (request side). |
| `events.go` | WS event type names + payload structs (server-push side). |
| `wire.go` | Envelope `{type, id, payload}` + JSON framing. |
| `hub.go` | Hub of connected clients, broadcast routing, per-session filtering. |
| `auth.go` | Token mint/verify (HMAC of timestamp+secret), stored in `~/.config/crush/token`. |

### 4.B — React web UI (`web/`)

Built with Rsbuild (React Compiler enabled). Mounted by `web/embed.go`
via `//go:embed all:dist`. See `web/README.md` (if it exists) for the
dev loop; otherwise `cd web && npm run dev` for the dev server and
`npm run build` to produce `web/dist/`.

Key components (`web/src/components/`):
- `Chat.tsx`, `Message.tsx` — message list + per-message rendering.
- `ChatInput.tsx`, `ChatToolbar.tsx` — input + actions.
- `Sidebar.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `StatusBar.tsx` — chrome.
- `ModelSelector.tsx`, `ProvidersModal.tsx`, `SettingsModal.tsx`,
  `LSPSettings.tsx`, `MCPSettings.tsx`, `PermissionDialog.tsx`,
  `LogsModal.tsx`, `SubAgentBlock.tsx`, `TodoList.tsx` — feature panes.

Tests: `web/tests/*.spec.ts` (Playwright). Each top-level feature has a
matching spec.

### 4.C — Database extensions

New migrations under `internal/db/migrations/` (all dated 2026-03-08
through 2026-03-13):

| Migration | Adds |
| --------- | ---- |
| `20260308000001` | `large_model_*`, `small_model_*` columns to `sessions` (per-session model overrides). |
| `20260308000002` | `session_permissions` table. |
| `20260308000003` | `system_prompt` column to `sessions` (per-session prompt override). |
| `20260309000001` | Cleanup of empty permission rows produced by `20260308000002`. |
| `20260310000001` | `pinned` flag on `messages`. |
| `20260311000001` | `hidden` flag on `messages` (used by silent background summaries). |
| `20260312000001` | `yolo` flag on `sessions` (per-session, replaces the global flag). |
| `20260312000002` | `enabled` flag on permission rows (soft-delete-friendly). |
| `20260313000000` | `large_model_reasoning_effort` column on `sessions`. |
| `20260313000001` | `reasoning_effort` column on `messages`. |

Generated SQL in `internal/db/permissions.sql.go`,
`internal/db/sessions.sql.go`, `internal/db/messages.sql.go`. Source
queries in `internal/db/sql/*.sql`.

### 4.D — Agent / coordinator extensions (`internal/agent/`)

Patches and additions in `agent.go`, `coordinator.go`:

- **Sliding context window** — when used tokens approach the model's
  context window, the oldest messages are trimmed inside `PrepareStep`
  rather than blocking the user on a synchronous summarisation call.
  Introduced in `b899cb4c`.
- **Silent background compaction** — when the window slides, the oldest
  50% of messages are summarised in the background; the running task
  is not interrupted. Introduced in `107c5faa`.
- **Queued compact** — explicit user-triggered `summarize` while a
  task is in flight gets queued and executed when the task ends.
  Introduced in `b899cb4c`.
- **Always-continue after auto-summary** — after a summary, the agent
  resumes the user's original task instead of stopping. Introduced in
  `9886d533`.
- **Stuck busy-state recovery** — if a summarisation fails or runs too
  long, the session's busy flag is force-released so the user can keep
  typing. Introduced in `9eb7e5e5`.
- **Empty-response detection** — when a provider closes the stream
  without sending any content (no text, tool_call, or reasoning), we
  now record `FinishReasonError` with an explicit message instead of
  the previous `FinishReasonUnknown` with empty parts (which the UI
  rendered as a blank block). Added in agent.go's `OnStepFinish`. See
  also Section 4.G for the matching front-end fallback. Marker:
  `// Fork patch: surface empty-stream as a visible error.`
- **Stream-progress watchdog** (`internal/agent/stream_watchdog.go`) —
  every fantasy stream callback bumps an atomic activity timestamp;
  a watchdog goroutine cancels the generation context if no callback
  fires for `streamIdleTimeoutDefault` (3 min default), overridable
  per app via `Options.StreamIdleTimeoutSeconds` in `crush.json`.
  Adds the "Codec must surface control" invariant: a provider that
  holds the HTTP body open but stops sending bytes (rate-limit,
  HTTP/2 stall, backend hiccup) can no longer freeze the agent
  indefinitely. On fire, the assistant message gets a
  `FinishReasonError("Stream stalled")` with the duration so the user
  knows why their turn ended. Backed by the 162-promise-all
  post-mortem (D:\dev\garnet-team\.crush): four streams (parent + 3
  sub-agents) all froze in a 9-second window when a provider stopped
  responding mid-stream, and the agent waited 1.5h before the user
  killed the process. **Tune up to 10–15 minutes** (e.g.
  `"stream_idle_timeout_seconds": 900`) when running extended-thinking
  models (Opus 4.7 / Sonnet 4.5 with large thinking_budget) — a long
  reasoning gap can legitimately exceed 3 min.
- **Detached-context flush at the error path** — the final
  `messages.Update` that records the assistant's finish part now uses
  `context.WithoutCancel(ctx)` + a short timeout, instead of the
  outer ctx. Without this, Ctrl-C in `crush run` (which cancels the
  signal.NotifyContext that fang gives every subcommand) would
  propagate `ctx.Canceled` into `Update` and leave the assistant
  message half-saved: tool calls present, no finish part — the
  "silent dying" pattern. Same fix applied to all error-path
  `Create`/`Update`/`List` calls.
- **Startup recovery of orphan assistants**
  (`internal/app/app.go::recoverInterruptedTurns`) — on every app
  start, before the coordinator is wired up, scan all sessions; any
  assistant message left without a finish part from a previous run
  gets a `FinishReasonError("Process restarted")` so the WUI
  immediately renders it as an interrupted turn rather than spinning
  forever. Safety net for cases the in-process defences can't catch:
  `kill -9`, power loss, OS reboot, panic-without-recovery.

### 4.E — CLI providers (`internal/agent/cliprovider/`)

The fork ships substantially more CLI integration than upstream:

- `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code` invocation (Windows-friendly NoPTY
  + StdoutPipe/StderrPipe, see `31592eff..a9897fca`).
- Claude CLI 1M-context models (`cli-claude-opus-1m`,
  `cli-claude-sonnet-1m`) wired as defaults for the `local-cli`
  provider.
- Gemini and Codex CLI MCP bridging — fork-side MCP server proxies
  external tool calls so non-MCP CLI models can use the same toolbox.
- `.mcp.json` loader (Claude Code format) at `internal/config/mcp_json.go`.
- Session resume across messages using prefix-hash validation, for
  Anthropic prompt caching (`1b9bd849`, `a32ce147`).
- Permission requests for external MCP tools (`a028f1cb`).
- Built-in CLI tools (WebSearch, WebFetch, Task, Agent) allowed in
  MCP mode (`f0471e77`).

### 4.F — Hooks in config

`internal/hooks/` was added upstream but we extended the `Hooks` block
in `crush.json` schema and surfaced it in `schema.json` so the user can
configure PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks via the standard config file
(see `docs/hooks/README.md`).

### 4.G — Front-end fallbacks

- **Per-session WebSocket message filtering** — incoming `messages`
  events are filtered against the currently active `sessionID` so an
  agent running in another session does not bleed into the open chat
  (`ceb1e1a4`).
- **Yolo sync on reconnect** — the WS client re-sends its yolo flag on
  every reconnect so a backend that restarted with empty per-session
  state inherits the user's last choice (`734ecc62`).
- **Empty-response rendering** — `web/src/components/Message.tsx`
  renders a visible `FinishErrorBlock` whenever a `finish` part carries
  `Reason === "error" | "canceled"`, and shows a placeholder for
  assistant messages that finished without any visible part. This
  pairs with Section 4.D's server-side empty-response detection. Marker:
  `// Fork patch: render explicit error/empty finish parts...`

### 4.H — Misc developer features

- `Makefile`, `build.go` — convenience entry points.
- `.claude/skills/deploy.md` — skill autocomplete entry.
- `internal/cmd/web.go` — the `crush web` subcommand (the default in
  this fork).
- `internal/swagger/` — annotations-only stub kept so a future
  REST-side rebirth could autogenerate docs; the WS server is the real
  API surface.

### 4.I — Parallel-process / multi-agent concurrency

Crush in this fork is increasingly used as a **sub-agent** spawned by an
orchestrator: typically 5+ `crush run --session X --json` processes
running concurrently in the same working directory and sharing one
`.crush/` folder (the shamir-db audit workflow is the canonical case).
On top of that, each process fan-outs internally to sub-agents in
separate goroutines. The defence layers live in two clusters.

**Cluster A — landed in `cfad5391` (2026-05-17)**

- `internal/session/lock.go` + `lock_unix.go` + `lock_windows.go` —
  cross-platform per-session exclusive file lock under
  `.crush/locks/session-<id>.lock` (flock on POSIX, LockFileEx on
  Windows). `agent.Run` acquires it after the in-process
  `IsSessionBusy` check so two crush processes cannot share a session
  id. OS auto-releases on death — no stale-lock cleanup. PID stamped
  for diagnostics.
- `recoverInterruptedTurns` age-filtered (>30s) so a starting process
  cannot mark a fresh streaming message from a parallel process as
  orphan.
- `log.go` per-entry `pid=N` attribute so interleaved Windows log
  writes can be split post-hoc via `jq 'select(.pid==N)'`.
- SQLite `busy_timeout=30000` + `synchronous=NORMAL` (already present
  via `db/connect.go`).
- `envelope.Error` / `envelope.Warnings` for orchestrator feedback.
- `CRUSH_FORBID_WRITES` env to block the model from writing through
  the write/edit tool into paths the orchestrator owns.
- coordinator auto-retry on `FinishReasonError("Stream stalled")`.

**Cluster B — landed in the follow-up (this section's commit)**

Cluster A closed the loudest races but the audit (recorded in chat
history) flagged remaining HIGH-severity gaps:

- **Atomic file writes.** `tools/write.go`, `tools/edit.go`,
  `tools/multiedit.go` previously used `os.WriteFile`, which is not
  atomic — a `kill -9` / OOM mid-write left the user's file
  truncated and the DB history snapshot taken *after* the write made
  no recovery possible. All six sites now use `fsext.AtomicWriteFile`
  (write to a sibling `.tmp` file, fsync, rename). The helper lives
  at `internal/fsext/atomic.go`.
- **Session cost: read-modify-write → atomic additive.** The
  `UpdateSession` SQL was reshaped to drop the `cost` column, and a
  new `IncrementSessionCost` (`cost = cost + ?`) was added. The
  `session.Save` Go API still exists for title/tokens/summary/todos
  but does not touch cost. New `Service.IncrementCost(ctx, id, delta)`
  for the additive path. `coordinator.updateParentSessionCost` and
  `agent.updateSessionUsage` (three call sites) now route cost
  through `IncrementCost` so concurrent sub-agent fan-out cannot lose
  accrued cost via interleaved Get-modify-Save. Token fields keep
  overwrite semantics (each step's `usage` is a cumulative snapshot,
  not a delta).
- **MCP id and settings.json flock.** `cliprovider/mcpserver.go`'s
  `qwenMCPID`, `geminiMCPID`, `registerQwen/GeminiMCP`,
  `deregisterQwen/GeminiMCP` previously did read-then-write of
  `.crush/{qwen,gemini}-mcp-id` and `~/.{qwen,gemini}/settings.json`
  without locking — two parallel `crush run` startups on a fresh
  project could both miss the id file, both generate distinct UUIDs,
  and end up with a split-brain MCP server name; settings.json edits
  could clobber each other. All six now wrap the critical section in
  `session.AcquireFileLock` (blocking variant of `TryAcquireSessionLock`,
  exposed via the new `internal/session/file_lock.go` +
  `file_lock_{unix,windows}.go`) and use `fsext.AtomicWriteFile` for
  the write.
- **Log rotation actually runs.** `internal/log/log.go` raised
  `MaxBackups` from 0 (= rotation disabled) to 3 and enabled
  `Compress`. Without this the active log file would grow unbounded
  the moment MaxSize was exceeded under parallel-process write
  pressure.
- **Permission cache invalidation.** `internal/permission/permission.go`
  previously held an in-memory cache of persistent grants loaded
  exactly once at startup, with `Request` scanning it under a RWMutex.
  An "always allow" granted in process A was therefore invisible to
  process B until B restarted (and in non-interactive `crush run` B
  would block on the prompt). The cache was removed; `Request` now
  hits the DB via a new indexed `MatchSessionPermission` SQL on every
  call. `GrantPersistent` stores `session_id=""` so the row matches
  any session, preserving the cross-session contract of the old
  loader.

**Follow-up polish (from the post-batch code review):**

- `internal/cmd/sessions.go` `sessions reset` was broken by the
  Save-drops-cost contract change — it set `sess.Cost=0` then called
  Save (which now ignores cost). Fixed by tracking the previous cost
  and applying a negative `IncrementCost` delta.
- `session.AcquireFileLockContext(ctx, path)` added next to the
  indefinite-blocking `AcquireFileLock`. Implemented as polling
  `TryAcquireFileLock` with exponential backoff (25→500ms cap) so a
  cancelled ctx does not leak an orphan goroutine holding the lock.
  `cliprovider/mcpserver.go` introduces `acquireMCPConfigLock` that
  wraps it with a hard 30s timeout — all six MCP id/settings flocks
  now use it, so a wedged sibling crush process cannot freeze the
  whole parallel-run fleet.
- New migration `20260517000001_permissions_dedup_and_indexes.sql`
  adds two things: a UNIQUE index on
  `session_permissions(session_id, tool_name, action, path)` to
  support `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` in CreateSessionPermission
  (prevents duplicate rows on repeated Always-Allow clicks now that
  the in-memory cache is gone), and a composite index on
  `(tool_name, action, path, enabled)` so `MatchSessionPermission`'s
  WHERE clause is index-backed under multi-process auto-approve load.
  The migration also pre-dedups any existing duplicate rows (keeping
  the oldest by id) so the UNIQUE constraint can be applied
  retroactively.
- `Service.IncrementCost` docstring on the interface now spells out
  the `delta == 0 → Get` short-circuit (used by
  `coordinator.updateParentSessionCost` to keep the parent-not-found
  error path).
- `TestDisabledPermissions_NotMatched` wraps its event receive in a
  `select` with a 2s deadline so a regression that silently
  auto-approves the disabled rule fails fast instead of waiting for
  `go test -timeout`.

**Audit items intentionally deferred (still HIGH but lower urgency):**

- The original audit listed "filetracker mtime persisted per-process"
  as deferred HIGH. A re-read of the code in this follow-up showed
  the filetracker is **already DB-backed** via the `read_files` table
  with `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE SET read_at = excluded.read_at`
  (`internal/db/sql/read_files.sql`). Last-writer-wins is benign for
  the cross-process case. Item resolved as a no-op — please don't
  re-open it.
- The audit's "parallel MCP stdio children" item (N processes spawn
  N children of every configured MCP server) is a design-level issue
  that needs documentation + an HTTP/SSE-transport recommendation,
  not a code fix. Tracked separately.

## 5. In-code markers

Whenever we patch an **upstream** file in a non-obvious way we leave a
comment like:

```go
// Fork patch: <one-line reason>. See CHANGELOG.fork.md (Section <X>).
```

Search the repo for `Fork patch:` to find every such site. Current
sites of interest (placed **after** the `package` line, not before, so
they don't pollute `go doc` output):

- `internal/cmd/root.go` — web subcommand replaces TUI launcher
  (Section 2 / 4.A).
- `internal/cmd/login.go` — no Go REST client to sync credentials to
  (Section 2).
- `internal/config/config.go` — Hooks block exposure + simplified
  ExtraHeaders/Body docs (Section 4.F).
- `internal/message/message.go` — added Pinned/Hidden/ReasoningEffort
  + removed upstream's debounced update layer (Section 2 / 4.C).
- `internal/permission/permission.go` — persistent per-session
  permissions + JSON tags moved to the wire layer (Section 4.A / 4.C).
- `internal/agent/coordinator.go` — N-session web orchestration,
  ModelOverride, TakeSummarizeQueue, cliprovider wiring (Section 4.D
  / 4.E).
- `internal/agent/agent.go` — empty-response detection in
  `OnStepFinish` (Section 4.D). This marker is inline at the patch
  site (not a file header) because it's a single-block change.
- `web/src/components/Message.tsx` — `FinishErrorBlock` rendering and
  empty-content fallback (Section 4.G). Two inline markers, one per
  patch site.
- `internal/agent/tools/write.go` / `edit.go` / `multiedit.go` —
  atomic file writes via `fsext.AtomicWriteFile` (write to tmp +
  rename) so a `kill -9` / OOM mid-write cannot leave the user's file
  half-truncated. Six sites total. See Section 4.I.
- `internal/db/sql/sessions.sql` — `UpdateSession` no longer writes
  the `cost` column; new `IncrementSessionCost` provides
  `cost = cost + ?` atomic accumulation. Matches
  `internal/session/session.go` `IncrementCost` service method. See
  Section 4.I.
- `internal/agent/agent.go` — `updateSessionUsage` now returns the
  cost delta; three call sites (main step-finish, summarize, manual
  summarize) call `sessions.IncrementCost` for the additive write.
  Marker is on the function comment.
- `internal/agent/coordinator.go` — `updateParentSessionCost`
  rewritten to use `IncrementCost` so concurrent sub-agent fan-out
  does not lose accrued cost via read-modify-write. See Section 4.I.
- `internal/agent/cliprovider/mcpserver.go` — `qwenMCPID`,
  `geminiMCPID`, `registerQwenMCP`, `deregisterQwenMCP`,
  `registerGeminiMCP`, `deregisterGeminiMCP` are wrapped in a
  `session.AcquireFileLock` on a sibling `.lock` file and switched to
  `fsext.AtomicWriteFile` so two parallel `crush run` processes
  cannot split-brain MCP IDs or clobber `~/.{qwen,gemini}/settings.json`.
  See Section 4.I.
- `internal/log/log.go` — lumberjack `MaxBackups` raised from 0 to 3
  and `Compress` enabled so the log file does not grow unbounded
  under parallel-process workloads. See Section 4.I.
- `internal/permission/permission.go` — startup pre-load into an
  in-memory cache was dropped; `Request` now consults the
  `MatchSessionPermission` SQL on every call so a persistent "always
  allow" granted in process A is immediately visible in process B
  without restart. `GrantPersistent` stores `session_id=""` to
  preserve the cross-session contract. See Section 4.I.

Larger fork-only files (the entire WebSocket server, `web/`,
`cliprovider` additions, etc.) do not need per-site markers — their
existence is the marker. Fork-only utility files added for the
concurrency layer (`internal/fsext/atomic.go`,
`internal/session/file_lock*.go`) are also marker-free for the same
reason.

### Batch 3 — Sub-agent guards (2026-05-01)

```

21c4294a 2026-05-01 fix: guard against undefined Parts in SubAgentBlock messages
```

### Batch 4 — Upstream merge + post-merge fixes (2026-05-16, pending commit)

The merge of upstream `main` (173 commits) was first attempted as an
"evil merge" that silently dropped `internal/workspace/`. After that
merge a separate fix was applied to the empty-response handling, which
in turn motivated the writing of this document.

Open work, not yet committed:
- Re-running the `origin/main..HEAD` merge with explicit conflict
  resolutions per Section 2.
- The empty-response detection patch in `agent.go` and matching
  fallback in `Message.tsx`.
- This document.

When this batch lands, replace this paragraph with the new commit list.

### Batch 5 — Parallel-process safety, cluster B (2026-05-17)

The cluster A work landed as `cfad5391`. Cluster B (this batch) closes
the remaining HIGH-severity items from the post-`cfad5391` audit and
re-classifies one item (filetracker) as already-fixed.

### Batch 6 — orchestrator UX hardening from 2026-05-17 audit feedback

The shamir-db 2× parallel audit run produced a focused bug report
(BUG 1 .. BUG 5 + Observation 6). This batch closes all of them.

**BUG 1 (HIGH) — `--format json` could yield invalid JSON silently.**
Stripper's brace-walker accepted balanced-but-not-valid output (real
case: model forgot the closing `]` before `,"post_flight":`). Added
`stripAndValidateJSON` which runs `json.Valid` on the stripped
candidate; on failure the envelope reports
`exit_reason="invalid_json"`, restores the ORIGINAL to `final_text`,
moves the invalid candidate to `assistant_notes`, and puts a
position-bearing `json.SyntaxError` in `error`. New `ErrInvalidStripJSON`
sentinel. 6 new tests in `strip_json_test.go` including the exact
shamir-db reproducer.

**BUG 2 (MEDIUM) — model ignores "no preamble" hint.**
Tightened `formatPresetJSON` (imperative voice, 8 explicit rules,
last-line repeat). Added `StrippedBytes` field to the envelope so
operators can graph compliance over time.

**BUG 3 (LOW) — `crush models` dials home on every call.**
Added `cache.Age()` + `providerCacheTTL` (24h default, override via
`CRUSH_PROVIDER_CACHE_TTL` env). `catwalkSync` and `hyperSync` now
skip the HTTP roundtrip when the on-disk cache is fresher than the
TTL. Test pkg `TestMain` sets TTL=0 so existing network-path tests
keep exercising it.

**BUG 4 (MEDIUM) — empty `error.code` when `exit_reason=error`.**
`buildRunResult` now emits a fallback message naming the most likely
causes (provider HTTP error, stream stall, OOM, context overflow)
when the model's Finish part carried no Message/Details. Also adds
a `truncation_hint` warning when `final_text` ends with `: , -` —
hints that the model was mid-composition when the error fired.

**BUG 5 (MEDIUM) — write-tool overwrites the stdout-redirect target.**
Already mitigated in `cfad5391` (CRUSH_FORBID_WRITES env). This batch
documents it: `crush run --help` gained a "Protecting harness-owned
files" section and the claude-init guide gained a matching section
with the canonical `CRUSH_FORBID_WRITES="$out" crush run > "$out"`
pattern. Marker bumped v5 → v6.

**Observation 6 — show pricing in `crush models show`.**
`modelsShowCmd` now prints `ctx=204.8k` + `$1.40 / 1M in, $4.40 / 1M
out (cached-in $0.26)` on a second indented line per slot, sourced
from the catwalk catalog. Same fields appear under `cost_per_1m_*`
keys in `--json` output. Custom/local models without a catalog
entry silently omit pricing (no broken display).

### Batch 7 — sub-agent aggregation + invalid_json regression fix (2026-05-17, session #3 feedback)

The shamir-db session #3 audit (5 parallel agents, glm-5.1,
markdown output) surfaced two issues:

**BUG (regression I introduced in batch 6): `exit_reason="invalid_json"`
fires under `--json` even when the operator did NOT pass
`--format json`.** Root cause: `StripJSONFences` trigger included
`asJSON` (the envelope flag). But `--json` is purely an envelope
shape; an operator can legitimately want JSON envelope with
markdown final_text inside. Wiring `--json` into the JSON-validation
trigger was a false-positive trap. Fix: trigger only on
`--format json` / `--format json-schema:*`. ~2 LoC + 11 unit tests
in `internal/cmd/run_format_test.go` covering format flag flow and
`composeUserPrompt` ordering.

**HIGH: parent collapses sub-agent fan-out output 7× in extreme
cases.** When the model uses the `agent` tool and you let
`--agents agent-allow` (default) run, the parent often *summarises*
sub-agent outputs into a one-paragraph wrap-up. The orchestrator
sees only the wrap-up, the detail lives in DB sub-sessions where
the upper LLM cannot easily reach it. Three-layer response:

1. **ALWAYS-ON warning.** When parent dispatched ≥2 sub-agents and
   `final_text` is <40% of their combined character count, append
   `"reduction-loss: final_text is N chars (X% of M combined
   sub-agent chars across K sub-session(s)). Re-run with
   --aggregation=attach or --aggregation=concat to recover…"` to
   `envelope.warnings`. No opt-in — the operator sees it whether
   or not they know the flag exists.

2. **OPT-IN `--aggregation concat`.** Appends a prompt nudge
   (`aggregationConcatPromptHint`) asking the parent to include
   each sub-agent's reply verbatim in `final_text`, in dispatch
   order, with labelled headings. Best for "I want one big string
   to grep through" workflows.

3. **OPT-IN `--aggregation attach`.** After Run completes, app
   queries the session DB for every sub-session with
   `parent_session_id == this run`, fetches each sub-session's
   last finished assistant message via `Messages.List` +
   `lastAssistantText`, truncates to `maxSubAgentTextChars` per
   entry, and surfaces them as
   `envelope.sub_agent_outputs: [{session_id, title, final_text,
   char_count}]`. Parent's `final_text` becomes a brief wrap-up
   (driven by `aggregationAttachPromptHint`). Best for machine
   consumers that want the structured set.

New SQL `ListSubSessions(parentSessionID)` (in `db/sql/sessions.sql`,
indexed on `parent_session_id` already). New service method
`Session.ListSubSessions`. `mockSessionService` updated accordingly.
New helper file `internal/app/sub_agents.go` with
`collectSubAgentOutputs`, `subAgentSummaryStats`, `lastAssistantText`
+ `maxSubAgentTextChars` cap.

`composeUserPrompt` now takes 4 hint arguments
(`format → agents → aggregation`) matching reasoning order.

### Batch 8a — Multi-JSON extractor (side patch, 2026-05-17)

Small models (GLM-5-turbo etc.) often emit prose preamble + JSON or even
multiple JSON values separated by prose. The new `stripAndExtractJSON`
replaces `stripAndValidateJSON` as the runtime entry point: it scans for
ALL balanced JSON values, validates each, and wraps N≥2 into a JSON array
with forensic notes. The old single-shot function is retained for existing
tests.

### Batch 8 — Survive SIGTERM during final composition (2026-05-17)

Four coordinated changes to prevent text loss when the process is killed
during the final streaming phase:

**1. Auto-checkpoint: periodic DB flush of in-progress assistant text.**
A coalescing ticker goroutine inside `Run()` periodically clones the
in-memory assistant message, adds `Finish{Partial: true}`, and calls
`messages.Update` under `sessionLock`. The ticker only writes when
`Parts` have actually changed (coalescing). The `Partial` finish marker
does NOT set `finished_at` in DB and does NOT count as "finished" for
`IsFinished()`. Default interval: 2s. Configurable via
`Options.CheckpointIntervalSeconds` (>0 = that many seconds, -1 =
explicitly disabled, 0 = use default). The goroutine is started on first
`OnTextDelta` and stopped on `OnStepFinish`.

**2. Smart timeout: `--timeout-extends-on-progress` resets deadline on
streaming activity.** When enabled, the stream watchdog extends its
deadline every time `bump()` is called (which happens on every streaming
event). An absolute hard cap from start time is enforced via
`--timeout-hard-cap` (0 = no cap). Without the flag, original idle-only
behavior is preserved. Rate-limited INFO log for deadline extensions
(every 30s). Flags are plumbed through `RunOverrides` →
`Coordinator.SetAgentTimeoutOptions` → `SessionAgent.SetTimeoutOptions`.

**3. Final composition log: INFO log when agent enters final text phase
after tool boundaries.** A `sawToolBoundary` bool is set on every tool
callback and reset after the first `OnTextDelta` that follows. When a
text delta arrives after tool boundaries, a single `slog.Info` is
emitted per step — a forensic marker for post-mortem debugging of
"time from tool-use to final-text-started".

**4. Recovery: `findOrphanPartial` surfaces orphan text in `--json`
envelope.** Scans session messages backwards for the latest assistant
with `IsPartial() && !IsFinished()`. Returns a `recoveredPartial`
struct (`{message_id, chars, last_flush_at, text}`). When found, the
JSON envelope gets `recovered_partial` populated and a WARN-level
warning appended to `warnings[]`. Only the latest orphan is surfaced.

### Batch 9 — claude-init always-replace, claude-del inverse, Markdown-first guideline (2026-05-17)

Three coordinated changes:

**1. `claude-init` always replaces.** Removed `--force` and `--replace`
flags. Every invocation now strips ALL existing crush-claude-init blocks
(any version) and writes a single fresh one. The slash command file
`.claude/commands/crush.md` is overwritten if it carries our sentinel; a
warning is printed if the file exists without the sentinel (someone else
owns it).

**2. `crush claude-del` (inverse).** New subcommand that undoes
`claude-init`: strips all crush-claude-init blocks from CLAUDE.md
(deletes the file if only our block was present), removes the slash
command if it has our sentinel. Idempotent and safe.

**3. Markdown-first output guideline.** Added "Output format: Markdown
is usually fine" section to both the repo's own `CLAUDE.md` and the
embedded `claude-init` template. Key idea: agents should default to
Markdown; JSON only when a CI step, jq pipeline, or fan-out harness is
the immediate consumer. Marker bumped v8 → v9.

### Batch 10 — Claude Haiku CLI model variants (2026-05-17)

Add four `CLISpec` entries for Claude Haiku (`--model haiku`) to the
`cliprovider.All` slice: `cli-claude-haiku`, `cli-claude-haiku-thinking`,
`cli-npx-claude-haiku`, `cli-npx-claude-haiku-thinking`. ContextWindow set
to 200_000 (Haiku 4.5 does not support 1M). Sonnet/Opus entries kept at
1_000_000 — Opus 4.6+ supports 1M, confirmed via Anthropic docs. New
test `TestAll_HaikuModelsRegistered` validates presence and context
window for all four IDs.

```

### Batch 11 — `crush models use/list/state`; `preset` and `set` removed (2026-05-17)

Reworked the model-selection UX around a small **atom registry** plus three
sharp commands. The previous two-pronged surface (`crush models set
--large X --small Y` plus the `crush models preset save/use/list/delete`
machinery) is gone — both are replaced by a single positional command and
a discoverability pair.

**1. `crush models use <large> <small>` [--global | --local].**
Two positional atoms, no flags for the model names themselves. Each
argument is either an atom from the registry (e.g. `opus-high`,
`glm5_turbo`) or a raw `provider/model[@level]` string as fallback for
anything not in the registry. `--global` (default) writes to the global
crush.json; `--local` to `./.crush/crush.json`.

**2. `crush models list`** prints the atom registry (filtered by
`EnabledProviders()` — disabled providers' atoms are hidden) followed by
an "OTHER MODELS" block listing every model id from every enabled
provider as raw `provider/model`. `--json` emits a structured object
`{atoms: [...], other_models: [...]}`. The atom rows render every effort
variant comma-separated on one line per model — opus-low through
opus-max all on the same row — so the operator can copy the exact string
they want.

**3. `crush models state` [--json]** shows the EFFECTIVE large/small
pair plus a per-scope breakdown (global / local) annotated with
`(effective)` / `(overridden by local)` / `(not set)`. When the
effective model matches an atom, the atom name is shown in parens:
`local-cli/cli-claude-opus effort=high (atom: opus-high)`. Aliased as
`crush models show` for backwards compat.

**Atom registry** (internal/cmd/models_atoms.go): 3 Anthropic atoms
(`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) × 5 effort levels read from `claude --help`
at first use (cached per process, fallback `[low, medium, high, xhigh,
max]`) plus 10 Z.AI atoms with no effort. Mixed pairs supported
(`opus-high glm5_turbo`).

**Removals:**
- `crush models set` → hidden cobra with `DisableFlagParsing` that prints
  a redirect notice to stderr and exits 2.
- `crush models preset` (entire `save`/`use`/`list`/`delete` ветвь) → same
  hidden-redirect treatment. The `ModelPresets` field in crush.json is
  silently ignored from now on.

### Batch 13 — `crush models unset` (2026-05-17)

Adds a one-liner way to remove a model override from the chosen scope
so the other scope takes effect, replacing the `rm .crush/crush.json`
workaround (which would destroy any unrelated settings in that file).

```
crush models unset [large|small|both] [--global | --local]
```

- Defaults to `both` slots and global scope.
- Missing keys are a no-op (exit 0) with a friendly note.
- After deletion, an empty `models: {}` object is stripped so the file
  stays clean.

### Batch 14 — `crush run` auto-bypasses inner CLI permissions (2026-05-18)

Fixes the silent-hang bug where `crush run` spawns an inner CLI sub-process
(`claude`, `codex`, or `gemini`) and the inner process blocks waiting for an
interactive permission prompt that nobody is there to answer.

Mechanism: `RunNonInteractive` now seeds the agent context with
`cliprovider.NonInteractiveContextKey = true`. Inside `cliModel.Stream`,
this key short-circuits to `yolo = true` even when the caller did NOT pass
the root `--yolo` flag. Consequence: `claudeArgs(yolo=true)` adds
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `codexArgs(yolo=true)` adds
`--approval-mode yolo`, etc. — all transparently.

Rationale: `crush run` IS the non-interactive entry point by design. Asking
operators to remember `crush --yolo run` is fragile (CLAUDE.md actively
discouraged it). The fix makes the right thing happen automatically while
preserving the explicit `--yolo` semantics for interactive TUI/web sessions
which still go through the original `yoloFn` path.

```
internal/agent/cliprovider/provider.go   new NonInteractiveContextKey + override in Stream

```

### Batch 12 — provider management commands (2026-05-18)

Extends the `crush providers` command family with full CRUD + model lifecycle
management, enabling operators to add custom providers, refresh model lists,
and track provider state transitions.

New commands:
- `crush providers list` — extended with `STATUS` column, `--grep` filtering
- `crush providers enable <id>` — re-enable a disabled provider
- `crush providers disable <id>` — disable with orphaned-slot warnings
- `crush providers add <id>` — new provider with model auto-fetch
- `crush providers remove <id>` — delete provider with `--yes` confirmation
- `crush providers update [<id> | --all]` — refresh model lists, show diffs
- `crush providers grep <pattern>` — sugar for `list --grep`

Model-source strategies:
- **Catwalk-known providers** (openai, anthropic, gemini, etc.) — pull cached
  model list from internal/config catwalk JSON; no HTTP call.
- **OpenAI-compatible (`openai-compat`)** — GET `<base_url>/models`, parse
  `{data: [{id, ...}]}`, map to catwalk.Model. Context window unknown; warns
  user to correct via future `providers update --set-ctx` flag.
- **Anthropic with custom base** — GET `<base_url>/v1/models` with
  x-api-key + anthropic-version headers; extracts id, display_name,
  context_tokens.
- **CLI providers** — model list from hardcoded cliprovider.go slice; no-op
  for update.

Orphan detection: when a provider's models change, warns if currently-preferred
`large`/`small` model is removed (`WARN: preferred <slot> = <id>/<model> no
longer exists — your '<slot>' slot is broken`).

Files touched:

```

### Batch 15 — strip our delegation block from CLAUDE.md in sub-agent Read (2026-05-18)

Closes the silent infinite-recursion bug where a sub-agent invoked via
`crush run` would read the workspace `CLAUDE.md`, see the "delegate work
to `crush run`" guidance that `crush claude-init` injected, and faithfully
spawn ANOTHER `crush run` — recursing until the timeout fired with no
real output.

Mechanism: the MCP `Read` tool exposed by `cliprovider` (which is the
only file-read interface a CLI sub-agent has when running through us)
checks if the requested path's basename is `CLAUDE.md` (case-insensitive).
If yes, it runs the file content through the same regex
`<!-- crush-claude-init:vN -->...<!-- /crush-claude-init -->` that
`internal/cmd/claude_init.go` uses to identify the block, and strips it
before returning to the sub-agent. The file on disk is never touched —
operators and external tools see the original CLAUDE.md unchanged. Only
the in-flight Read result is filtered.

Safe-failure mode: a malformed CLAUDE.md with an opening marker but no
closing marker is returned unchanged (the regex requires both halves),
so a sub-agent gets a corrupted file's contents visibly rather than
having half the file silently disappear.

```

### Batch 16 — agentguard: refuse nested AI-agent invocations from bash tool (2026-05-18)

Hard wall around the recursion path that batch 15 only patched via the
Read tool. A sub-agent that gets clever and tries to spawn another agent
through bash (the obvious workaround once CLAUDE.md no longer tells it to
delegate) now gets a tool-failure response with a clear message.

New package `internal/agent/agentguard` exports `Check(command string) error`
that returns a `*DeniedError` when the command would launch any known AI
coding agent CLI. The check is wired into BOTH bash interfaces:

  - `internal/agent/tools/bash.go` (native bash tool — used by crush
    when it runs an agent without going through a CLI provider)
  - `internal/agent/cliprovider/mcpserver.go` registerBashTool
    (the MCP Bash tool used by claude / codex / gemini when they run
    under `crush run` with --bare-style invocation)

Denylist covers the 2026 agent landscape:

  - Proprietary: claude, codex, gemini, qwen, cody, windsurf
  - Open-source: opencode, aider, cline, cursor-agent, continue, amp,
    goose, mentat, forge, tabby
  - Self: crush (recursive crush invocations are never the right answer)

Plus launch-form coverage:

  - Direct binary with extensions: .exe / .cmd / .bat / .ps1 / .sh / .py
  - Absolute and relative paths (`/usr/bin/claude`, `./claude`)
  - Shell wrappers: bash/sh/dash/zsh/ksh/fish/nu `-c "X"`, cmd `/c X`,
    powershell/pwsh `-Command X` / `-EncodedCommand X` — recursed into
  - Package runners: npx, pnpm dlx, yarn dlx, bunx, bun x, pipx run,
    uv tool run, uvx — checked against deniedNpmPackages / deniedPypiPackages
  - Wrappers: exec, command, time, nohup — stripped before matching
  - Leading env-var assignments (POSIX `FOO=bar BAR=baz claude`) skipped
    before the executable token is read
  - Chained commands: split on top-level `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`; every
    segment is independently checked
  - Quote-aware tokenization so `claude -p "hello world"` is still
    recognised as starting with `claude`

False-positive risk on `continue` (shell keyword) and `command` (shell
builtin) is accepted — typical scripts do not invoke them as the first
token of a standalone command. If it surfaces we'll add an allowlist.

### Batch 17 — standardize stdin prompt file location to `.crush/stdin/` (2026-05-18)

Documentation-only change. Formalizes a convention: when an orchestrator
(Claude Code, crush wrapper harness, CI job) needs to pass a multi-line prompt
to `crush run` via stdin (e.g. `< ./.crush/stdin/task.prompt`), it should write
to a file under `./.crush/stdin/` (co-located with workspace data) rather than
scattering files into `/tmp`. No new directories are created at runtime — the
operator's harness creates them on first write. The directory is covered by the
existing `.crush/` gitignore rule, so cleanup is automatic.

Files touched:

```

### Batch 18 — `crush sessions` subcommands for orchestrator observability (2026-05-18)

Three new `crush sessions` subcommands for monitoring and debugging session state
at the CLI. Designed for orchestrator visibility into running or completed
sessions — allowing scripts and CI jobs to inspect session metadata, monitor
lock files, and stream messages as they complete.

Subcommands:

- `crush sessions show <id> [--json] [--with-messages] [--full]` — inspect single
  session with optional message thread; default: text output with truncated
  system prompt and message previews; --json for structured format
- `crush sessions locks [--json] [--stale-only]` — scan `.crush/locks/` for
  active lock files (one per running session); report session id, PID, acquisition
  time, duration, stale status (process dead OR lock older than 10 minutes);
  default: tabwriter table; --json for NDJSON
- `crush sessions tail <id> [--follow] [--from-message <id>] [--format text|ndjson]`
  — stream messages from a session; default: print all existing messages and exit;
  --follow: poll and print new messages until session finishes or Ctrl+C;
  --from-message: resume after a specific message ID (skip earlier); default:
  human-readable blocks per message; --format ndjson: JSON per line for piping

All three commands use simple polling against the SQLite message store (no
streaming DB connections required). Error codes are predictable (0 = success,
1 = session/file not found, 2 = database error mid-stream).

Files touched:

```
internal/cmd/sessions.go                  add 3 commands + init() registration + implementation

### Batch 19 — `crush mcp` command family for MCP server management (2026-05-18)

Add new CLI command family `crush mcp <subcommand>` to manage Model Context
Protocol servers configured in crush.json. Follows the `crush providers`
pattern with list, show, enable, disable, restart, test, add, remove, and
set subcommands. Default write scope is --local (project config); --global
targets the user-level config.

Subcommands:

- `crush mcp list [--json] [--grep <pattern>]` — table with ID, NAME, TYPE,
  STATUS, TOOLS, COMMAND/URL columns. TOOLS shows count from live session
  or "-" if not reachable. --grep filters by id/type/command/url.
- `crush mcp show <id> [--json]` — full config for one server
- `crush mcp enable <id> [--global|--local]` — set disabled=false (default: --local)
- `crush mcp disable <id> [--global|--local]` — set disabled=true (default: --local)
- `crush mcp restart <id>` — placeholder (hot-reload planned for future)
- `crush mcp test <id> [--timeout 10s]` — connectivity test (placeholder)
- `crush mcp add <id> --type <stdio|sse|http> [--command ...] [--url ...]
  [--arg ...] [--env ...] [--header ...]` — create new server (default: --local)
- `crush mcp remove <id> [--global|--local]` (alias: `rm`) — delete from config
- `crush mcp set <id> [--command ...] [--type ...] [--arg ...] [--env ...]
  [--header ...] [--url ...] [--disabled ...]` — update fields in-place

Files touched:

```
internal/cmd/mcp.go              new — 9 subcommands + helper types + flag registration

### Batch 20 — keep MCP bridge active in yolo mode (security fix) (2026-05-18)

Closes a regression introduced by batch 14. The condition that decided
whether to spawn crush's MCP bridge inside the inner `claude` CLI was
`UseCrushMCP && !yolo && perms != nil` — the `!yolo` half meant that any
non-interactive `crush run` (which batch 14 marks as yolo-equivalent so
inner claude gets `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) silently skipped the
MCP setup. Without MCP setup we never passed `--allowedTools`, so claude
ran with its native Bash/Write/Edit/Task toolset — completely bypassing
the agentguard denylist (batch 16, which only inspects calls coming
through `mcp__crush__Bash`).

Fix: drop `!yolo` from the condition. yolo only ever needed to flip the
bypass-permissions flag for claude itself; it has nothing to say about
whether our MCP bridge sits in the loop. With the bridge on, claude's
toolset is restricted to `mcp__crush__*` plus the safe built-ins
(WebSearch, WebFetch, Task, Agent), agentguard is back in force, and
the audit/permission machinery applies to every shell call.

Verified empirically: before the patch, `crush run` invocations showed
`args: --model haiku ... --effort medium --dangerously-skip-permissions`
in cliprovider logs (no `--allowedTools`, no MCP). After: full
`--allowedTools mcp__crush__Bash,…` + `--mcp-config` lines, matching the
shape we already saw on the shamir-db workspace.

### Batch 21 — `crush ping` and `crush ping-fast` (model connectivity check) (2026-05-18)

Add two new top-level commands to verify the configured large/small models
are reachable, responsive, and have valid credentials. Complements
`crush providers test <id>` (which probes the provider's API catalog endpoint);
ping is slot-based, not provider-based, and actually exercises the model
with a real completion request.

**Design choice: two separate commands vs one `--fast` flag:**
Chose two commands (`ping` and `ping-fast`) for clarity — each has its own
cobra.Command with separate help text and examples. Less cognitive load than
a flag that changes which model is tested.

**Implementation notes:**

- Both commands bypass the full agent loop and session persistence.
- Provider is built directly using the provider factories from coordinator.go.
- System prompt instructs model to reply with exactly "OK".
- Measures wall-clock latency from request start to stream completion.
- Exit codes: 0 (ok), 1 (error/auth), 2 (timeout), 3 (degraded—model responded but not "OK").
- `--json` outputs structured result with provider/model/status/latency_ms/response/tokens.
- `--timeout` defaults to 15s, `--prompt` allows custom user message.
- Cost calculation skipped (requires model pricing config, not exposed to commands).
- No session DB pollution: throwaway requests don't persist to crush sessions list.

**Tested coverage:**

- Command metadata (Use, Short, Long, Examples)
- Flag registration (json, timeout, prompt)
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling of PingResult
- Error/timeout/degraded response handling
- Status codes mapping

### Batch 21 — `crush ping` / `crush ping-fast` liveness probes (2026-05-18)

Cheap one-shot probes for verifying the configured large/small model is
reachable, the API key still works, and the round-trip latency. Today
operators had to run a real `crush run` with a stub prompt to test this,
which creates a session, persists messages, drags MCP setup with it,
and accumulates cost.

New commands:
- `crush ping [--json] [--timeout 15s] [--prompt "<custom>"]` — pings
  the **large** slot. Sends a one-line system prompt ("reply with OK")
  and a one-token user prompt, captures provider + model + latency_ms +
  cost_usd + tokens, returns exit 0 (ok), 1 (error), 2 (timeout), or
  3 (degraded — alive but didn't return "OK").
- `crush ping-fast` — same shape for the **small** slot.

Default text output prints provider, status, latency, response, tokens,
cost — the operator's triage info in five lines. `--json` mirrors the
shape for jq pipelines: `{provider, model, effort, atom, status,
latency_ms, response, prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, cost_usd,
error}`. Four tests in ping_test.go cover success, error propagation,
timeout, and the degraded path.

**Known limitation:** CLI-backed providers (cli-claude-*, cli-codex-*,
cli-gemini-*) currently return `Provider type not supported: "cli"` —
sub-agent skipped that branch. Fix is a one-screen patch: invoke the
underlying binary directly (e.g. `claude --model haiku -p ping`) with
a short timeout instead of going through the agent stream loop.
Deferred to a follow-up batch.

**Completion (2026-05-18):**

All implementation gaps closed:
1. Fixed `fantasy.AgentStreamCall` usage: removed message history, pass
   only `Prompt` field for stateless ping request.
2. Cost calculation implemented: looks up model pricing from
   `ProviderConfig.Models` and applies formula `(in_price/1M * prompt_tokens)
   + (out_price/1M * completion_tokens)`. Returns 0.0 if model not in
   pricing table.
3. Comprehensive test suite with 14+ functional tests:
   - `TestPingLargeModelSucceeds` / `TestPingSmallModelSucceeds` — verify
     "OK" response triggers status=ok, exit code 0
   - `TestPingErrorPropagates` — auth errors trigger status=error, exit
     code 1
   - `TestPingTimeoutDetected` — deadline exceeded triggers status=timeout,
     exit code 2
   - `TestPingDegradedResponse` — non-"OK" response triggers status=degraded,
     exit code 3
   - `TestCalculatePingCost_*` — cost calculation with various pricing
     scenarios (with pricing, no models, model not found, zero pricing)
   - `TestLookupAtomForModel_KnownModels` — atom label mapping verified
   - `TestPingResult_JSONMarshal` / `TestPingResult_WithError` — JSON
     serialization
   - Command metadata and flag registration tests

Files touched:

Also folded in this commit (background sub-agent from batch 19 kept
polishing after the initial batch-19 commit landed):
- internal/cmd/mcp.go: +158/-43 (mcpmanager integration, default
  scope changed to --local for writes, improved Long/Example help,
  better tools-list probe error handling)
- internal/cmd/mcp_test.go: +315/-69 (expanded coverage of enable/
  disable/restart edge cases, JSON output shape assertions)

### Batch 22 — remove CLAUDE.md delegation block (recursion-prone footgun) (2026-05-18)

**Postmortem.** Over the course of one day this fork accumulated 470+
orphan processes (95 claude.exe, 290 bash.exe, 80 go.exe, 3 crush.exe)
on the operator's Windows machine. Root cause: the always-on
delegation block that `claude-init` installed into the workspace's
CLAUDE.md ("you are the strategist, crush is the worker — delegate
everything"). Every Claude Code session opening the workspace read it
on startup and tried to delegate ANY task back into `crush run`, which
spawned another Claude Code via cliprovider, which read the same block,
and so on. Watchdogs killed outer parents but on Windows the child
processes became OS-level orphans (no Job Object kill-on-close).

The cycle was already partially closed at the tool-call layer:
- batch 16 (agentguard) denies `crush`/`claude`/`codex`/etc in our MCP
  Bash tool.
- batch 20 force-keeps the MCP bridge active in yolo mode so inner
  claude is locked to mcp__crush__* and agentguard actually fires.

But the cleanest fix is to remove the trigger entirely: stop telling
sub-agents to delegate.

**Change.** `claude-init` now:
- Writes NOTHING into CLAUDE.md.
- STRIPS any pre-existing crush-claude-init block (any version, v1..v10)
  from CLAUDE.md when invoked, so users upgrading from an older crush
  get a clean workspace.
- Removes CLAUDE.md entirely if stripping leaves it empty (mirrors
  `claude-del`'s behaviour).
- Continues to install / refresh the `.claude/commands/crush.md`
  slash-command — that file is now self-contained (full delegation
  guidance inline) and triggered ONLY by an explicit `/crush <task>`
  from the operator. Never auto-discovered.

Also removed:
- `crush claude-print` — there's no longer a block to print to stdout.
- The whole `claudeInitBlock()` template function in claude_init.go
  (lines 165..532, ~370 LoC of long-form prose), the
  `claudeInitMarkerStart`/`End` constants, and the related "v8"/"v9"/
  "v10" marker bump apparatus.

Test coverage rewritten for the new behaviour: 8 new claude-init tests
covering strip-only mode, empty-file deletion, multi-version stripping,
slash-command install/skip/overwrite. claude-del tests unchanged.

Defence-in-depth still in place: agentguard (batch 16) + MCP-bridge
re-activation (batch 20) keep blocking nested AI-agent invocations
even if some operator manually puts a delegation hint back. The
removed block was only the *trigger* — the agent containment layer
stays.

### Batch 23 — upstream merge v0.72.0 + system-prompt compression (2026-05-26)

This batch covers two unrelated chunks landed back-to-back: a compression
of the system prompt that ships with every `crush run`, and the
upstream-merge of 42 commits (v0.71.0 + v0.72.0).

**System-prompt compression (commit `882ffccd`)**

`internal/agent/templates/coder.md.tpl` was 4922 bytes / 96 lines —
fourteen dispersed rules plus four prose blocks (`<workflow>`,
`<editing>`, `<coding>`, `<skills_usage>`) that mostly restated the
rules in different words. Restructured into 5 thematic blocks (editing
discipline, execution, I/O contract, safety boundary, project context)
totalling 2772 bytes / 41 lines. Every behavioural hook preserved:
the will-to-finish (autonomous + finish-every-part + only-stop-for-real-
blocks + try-different-approach), the code-caution (read-before-edit +
exact-whitespace + 3–5-lines-context + strict-scope + never-commit/push/
amend/--no-verify), and the output contract (under 4 lines, no emojis,
user's language, `crush run --json` needs `final_text`). ~44 % size
reduction per invocation; saves ~600 input tokens on every native API
call and every cliprovider subprocess invocation (both render this
template).

**Upstream merge — `origin/main` 42 commits → fork main**

Backup branch: `backup/before-merge-20260526-124533`.

Per-file decisions (anything not listed below was a clean auto-merge):

| File / area | Decision | Reasoning |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| All `internal/ui/*` modifications (~12 commits) | `git rm` | TUI removed in fork, see Section 2 default rule |
| `internal/server/proto.go`, `config.go`, `cmd/server*.go`, `client/`, `backend/`, `workspace/`, `cla-signatures.json`, new upstream `backend_test.go` / `ui/*_test.go` | `git rm` | client-server REST architecture not used |
| `go.mod` / `go.sum` (UU) | `--theirs` + `go mod tidy` + explicit `go get charm.land/fang/v2` + `replace github.com/u-root/u-root => v0.14.1-...` | upstream fantasy bump pulled u-root v0.16.0 which broke `mvdan.cc/sh/moreinterp/coreutils` (`gzip.New()` signature mismatch); pinned v0.14.1 to match what works with sh/moreinterp |
| `internal/agent/templates/coder.md.tpl` (UU vs upstream `1811bec2`) | combine | kept our compressed 5-block version (from `882ffccd`), wove their "use `offset`/`limit` for large files" guidance into block 1 |
| `internal/agent/tools/view.go` `DefaultReadLimit` (auto-merged to upstream 200) | manual override to **500** | upstream `1811bec2` cut 2000→200 to push agents toward offset/limit. We picked 500 as a compromise — small enough to discourage "read everything", large enough to cover most of our `.go` files in one pass so cliprovider subprocess agents (claude/codex/gemini) don't round-trip per read. `// Fork merge note` left in `view.go` |
| `internal/agent/tools/bash.go` + `safe.go` + `safe_test.go` + new `recordingPermissionService` tests (`96728b15`) | upstream verbatim | clean security fix: `containsCommandChaining()` blocks the allowlist bypass `ls && rm -rf /`. Stubbed three extra DB-backed methods on the test mock to satisfy our extended `permission.Service` interface |
| `internal/permission/permission.go` (UU + `6b312bee`) | combine | kept our DB-persistence (`ListSessionPermissions` / `UpdatePermissionEnabled` / `DeletePermission` + per-session yolo + cross-process direct-DB lookup) + adopted upstream's `skip atomic.Bool` race fix (`SetSkipRequests`/`SkipRequests` Load/Store, init via `svc.skip.Store(skip)` after struct ctor) |
| `internal/permission/permission_test.go` `TestSkipRace` | adapted | rewrote the `NewPermissionService(...)` call to our extended signature (ctx, workingDir, skip, allowedTools, q) using the existing `newTestService` helper |
| `internal/agent/agent.go` (5 UU clusters) | combine | kept our `updateSessionUsage(...) float64` signature — critical for our `sessions.IncrementCost(delta)` race-safe additive UPDATE under parallel `crush run` processes. Inside, replaced our direct token-counter assignment with upstream's `updateSessionTokenCounters` helper (doesn't overwrite accumulated counters with zero — `74e6e378`). In the streaming loop, prepended `usage, _ := fallbackStepUsage(stepMessages, stepResult)` so the new estimator (`6ed8852b`) corrects providers that omit final usage chunks. In `Summarize`, kept our `re-fetch session before save` (preserves user todo edits during summary stream) + `IncrementCost` pattern + adopted upstream's `summaryCompletionTokens(usage, summaryMessage)` helper. Took the two new helper functions verbatim. **Rejected**: their `estimated bool` parameter on `updateSessionUsage` (drives the TUI `EstimatedUsage` marker — Section 2 default rule); their `a.eventTokensUsed(...)` publish (no consumer in our WebSocket fan-out) |
| `internal/agent/coordinator.go` (UU + `2faa467a`) | restored ours | upstream `6716ef09` threaded a `skillsMgr *skills.Manager` parameter through `NewCoordinator`; auto-merge left both that param and `skills.DiscoverFromConfig` call in. Stripped the parameter and restored our pre-merge `discoverSkills` body (uses `skills.DiscoverBuiltinWithStates` + `skills.DiscoverWithStates` directly) and its 7-arg `logDiscoveryStats` helper. `2faa467a`'s reasoning-effort guard (`if !model.SupportsReasoningEffort { …only thinking }`) auto-merged cleanly |
| `internal/skills/skills.go` (UU) | combine struct only | kept our `Source` field (drives `DiscoverCommands` scrape of `~/.{claude,gemini,qwen,cursor,zed,windsurf,crush}/commands/` that the WebUI surfaces as slash-commands — fork-only feature), added their two new boolean flags (`UserInvocable`, `DisableModelInvocation`) so SKILL.md files using them parse without error. **Rejected** the rest of their skills-architecture rewrite |
| `internal/skills/{catalog,manager,manager_test}.go` (upstream-added, ~600 LoC) | `git rm` | Manager/Catalog wraps per-workspace state for their multi-client backend (one Manager per workspace + `WithGlobalMirror` fallback for local TUI). We have a single embedded `App` per process and a WebSocket hub for fan-out — there is nothing to manage |
| `internal/proto/skills.go` (upstream-added) | `git rm` | wire types for their REST client-server skills events — no consumer |
| `internal/proto/proto.go` `Workspace.Skills []SkillState` field | dropped | dangling reference to removed `SkillState` |
| `internal/app/app.go` (UU + auto-merged callsites) | keep ours | dropped their `setupEvents() / setupSubscriber[T any](...)` block (forwards service brokers into a bubbletea `tea.Msg` pubsub — TUI infrastructure). Stripped `Skills *skills.Manager` field, `skillsMgr` parameter on `New(...)`, and `app.Skills` argument to `NewCoordinator(...)` — all came in via auto-merge from their multi-client rewrite |
| `internal/cmd/root.go` (UU 3 clusters) | `git checkout --ours` | upstream injected 418 lines of client-server bootstrap (`setupClientServerWorkspace`, `connectToServer`, `ensureServer`, `spawnAndWaitReady`, `localSkillsDiscoveryConfig`) into `setupApp()`. Our HEAD `setupApp()` is the simple embedded path — `appInstance, err := app.New(ctx, conn, store); return appInstance, nil`. Also stripped their imports of `internal/session` / `internal/skills` / `internal/ui/common` / `internal/ui/model` |
| `internal/session/session.go` (UU + 5 auto-merged callsites) | keep ours + cleanup | restored our `ListAll` + value-receiver `fromDBItem`. Stripped the auto-merged `EstimatedUsage` infrastructure that came in as TUI-marker plumbing for upstream `2736e487 fix(ui): mark estimated context usage` + `9595d1f0 fix(session): preserve estimated usage marker`: removed `Session.EstimatedUsage` field, `service.estimatedUsageMu` mutex + `estimatedUsage` map, the three setter methods (`apply` / `set` / `clear`), and the 5 callsites that auto-merge had sprinkled through `Delete` / `Get` / `GetLast` / `Save` / `ListAll`. Section 2 default rule |
| `internal/session/session_test.go` (AA) | `git checkout --ours` | our 242-line in-memory-SQLite test vs their 81-line stub — ours covers more behaviour |
| `internal/server/events.go` + `server.go` (UU) | `git checkout --ours` | upstream rewrote both as REST `/v1/...` proto-conversion helpers (`messageToProto`, `sessionToProto`, `wrapEvent`, `recoverHandler` mux wrapper). Ours are the WebSocket subscriber + handler dispatch. Different architectures. `// Fork merge note` already in place from prior merges |
| `internal/server/events_test.go` + `recover_test.go` | deleted | upstream-added tests for `messageToProto` / `recoverHandler` — both reference functions we never adopted |
| `internal/client/config_test.go` | deleted | orphan test from the deleted `internal/client/` package |

**New rules added to `CHANGELOG.fork.md` Section 2 — "Auto-reject all
upstream TUI / client-server features".** Explicit, named patterns to
catch on future merges (UI files, server/REST stack, Manager/Catalog
abstractions, `setupEvents` + `tea.Msg` bridges, EstimatedUsage-style
TUI marker plumbing, auto-merged callsites of removed types). The
intent is to stop asking the user about TUI/CS additions — the decision
is permanent.

Verification:

- `go build ./...` — clean
- `go vet ./...` — clean (modulo the pre-existing `csync.Map` lock-by-
  value warning unrelated to this merge)
- `go test -count=1 -timeout=300s ./...` — zero regressions vs pre-merge
  snapshot. All post-merge failures (`TestConfig_configureProviders*`,
  `TestGlobWithDoubleStar/*`, `TestListDirectory/*`, `TestStreamExitError`)
  were already failing pre-merge on Windows (Windows path-slash + cred
  resolution flakes). New failures: 0.
- Smoke: built `crush.exe`, ran `crush sessions list` / `sessions locks`
  / `--help` — all clean
- All 42 upstream commits absorbed or explicitly rejected (every
  rejection logged in this batch entry or via `// Fork merge note`
  in the touched file)

### Batch 24 — sessions monitoring UX: tool-call previews + watch live-tail (2026-05-26)

Two changes that make watching agent runs actually pleasant. Until now,
following a `crush run` session looked like a wall of `[tool: bash]` /
`[tool-result: bash]` lines — you knew the agent was *doing things*
but not *which things*. And `crush sessions watch` printed a dashboard
of active sessions, which duplicates `sessions list` + `sessions locks`
and is not what an operator usually wants.

**Tool-call argument previews in the message renderer.**

`printMessageWithTime` (text mode) now renders the most informative
argument from each tool call's JSON input next to the tool name. New
helpers `formatToolCallPreview` and `formatToolResultPreview` in
`internal/cmd/sessions_render.go`. Per-tool field priority hand-curated
for the common cases (`bash`→command, `view`→file_path[:offset+limit],
`edit`/`multiedit`/`write`→file_path, `grep`→pattern[+path],
`glob`→pattern, `ls`→path, `fetch`/`web_fetch`/`agentic_fetch`→url,
`download`→url→file_path, `sourcegraph`→query, `agent`/`sub_agent`/`task`
→description (then prompt), `todo`/`todowrite`→item count). Generic
fallback for unknown tools picks the first non-empty string field in
alphabetical order. Rune-truncated to 80 chars (tool calls) / 200 chars
(tool results). Multibyte-safe. Affects `sessions last`, `sessions tail`,
`sessions pick`, `sessions watch <id>` — every text-mode message render
in the project.

Before:

    [tool: bash]
    [tool-result: bash]
    [tool: edit]
    [tool-result: edit]

After:

    [tool: bash] cd D:/dev/go/crush && go build ./... 2>&1 | head -30
    [tool-result: bash] no output
    [tool: edit] D:/dev/go/crush/internal/cmd/queue.go
    [tool-result: edit] <result> (+21 lines)

**`sessions watch` reshaped: drop dashboard, default to picker → live-tail.**

The old dashboard mode (auto-refreshed table of active sessions with
PULSE / AGE / LAST_TOOL / TOKENS / COST columns) was removed — it
duplicated `sessions list` + `sessions locks` and crowded the command
with three modes (no-args / `--pick` / `<id>`) that obscured the actual
job. `watch -n 3 'crush sessions list'` in the shell trivially
reproduces what the dashboard did. Final shape:

    crush sessions watch          → interactive picker, then live-tail
    crush sessions watch <id>     → live-tail directly (short hash OK)

Live-tail prints existing messages, polls every `--interval` (default
1s) for new ones, and exits cleanly when the session ends. End
detection has three independent signals, any of which terminates:

    (a) the session row has a non-empty EndedReason
    (b) the lock file disappeared AND ≥1 message exists (the "≥1
        message" guard avoids racing the acquirer that has opened the
        lock but not yet written its first message)
    (c) the latest assistant message has a non-partial Finish.Reason

The decision lives in the pure helper `isSessionFinishedFromState`
so it is unit-testable without an app / DB / filesystem.

On exit, `formatWatchSummary` renders the end-of-watch block:

    --- session ended ---
    id:       batch30-runaway-fork-tree-queue
    title:    Batch 30: Sessions cancel, fork, tree, queue
    reason:   stop
    duration: 185h30m
    tokens:   183,706 (prompt 183,669 + completion 37)
    cost:     $0.5100

`Ctrl+C` interrupts and prints `(interrupted — session still running)`
*without* a summary — keeps the "I stopped watching" / "the session
ended" distinction obvious. Title line is omitted when empty; budget
suffix appended only when `BudgetMaxCost > 0`.

Drive-by fix in `sessionsLastCmdRun`: the function called
`resolveSessionID` to map a short hash to a full ID and then *ignored*
the result, passing `args[0]` (the hash) directly into
`Messages.List`. Short-hash invocations returned empty output. Now
uses `sess.ID`. Same fix `sessions tail` already had.

Tests (`internal/cmd/sessions_render_test.go` + `sessions_watch_test.go`):

- `formatToolCallPreview` — 24 table cases (every per-tool branch +
  invalid-JSON fallback + unknown-tool fallback + case-insensitive
  matching + multibyte truncation + empty/whitespace input)
- `formatToolResultPreview` — 7 cases (empty, single-line short / at-200 /
  long, multiline with leading whitespace)
- `truncatePreview` / `stringField` / `intField` — basic invariants
- `isSessionFinishedFromState` — 8 cases (each of the three signals
  individually, the "lock gone but no messages yet" race guard, the
  no-signal live-session case, transient DB errors must NOT terminate,
  Partial=true Finish must NOT terminate, EndedReason wins over
  FinishPart when both are set)
- `formatWatchSummary` — full layout / with budget / no title / no
  CreatedAt (no panic, "0s" duration)
- `formatWatchInt` — thousands separator at every order-of-magnitude
  boundary
- `formatAge` — boundary cases at 60s / 3600s

Build clean, vet clean (modulo the pre-existing `csync.Map` lock-by-
value warning), full `./internal/cmd/...` test suite green.

### Batch 31 — model aliases: top opus → Opus 4.8; ownership markers out of `description` (2026-05-29)

Opus 4.8 shipped. Two related changes across the two model-alias
subsystems: the `claude-init` slash-commands / sub-agents and the
`crush models use` short-code table.

**Top opus shortcuts now resolve to `claude-opus-4-8`.** In
`allModelCommands` (`internal/cmd/claude_init.go`) the top-of-family
opus aliases `ol/om/oh/ox/oxx` — and their agent twins
`aol/aom/aoh/aox/aoxx` — were bumped from `claude-opus-4-7` to
`claude-opus-4-8`. The versioned `o47*` / `ao47*` family stays pinned to
`claude-opus-4-7`, so 4.7 remains reachable by its own prefix now that it
is no longer the top. No `o48*` family was added — 4.8 is reached via the
top aliases, matching the prior arrangement where the top mirrored the
newest version. The display labels in `renderShortCodesBlock`
(`internal/cmd/models_atoms.go`) were updated to match.

**Ownership sentinels moved out of the visible `description`.** The
`<!-- crush-model-command:v1 -->` / `<!-- crush-model-agent:v1 -->`
markers used to sit inside the YAML `description:` field, so they leaked
into the Claude Code command list and the agent picker / tool listing
(e.g. `aoh: <!-- crush-model-agent:v1 --> claude-opus-…`). They are
load-bearing — `claude-init` and `claude-del` both use a whole-file
`strings.Contains(data, sentinel)` to tell our files from foreign ones
before overwriting / deleting — so they can't simply be removed. The
frontmatter must stay on line 1 (a leading comment makes Claude Code fail
to parse the YAML and render that first line as the description — which is
also why `crush.md`'s own leading sentinel shows up as its listed
description), so the marker is now an HTML comment in the body:

- commands have a tiny body (`$ARGUMENTS`), so the marker is buried ~50
  blank lines down (`sentinelBodyGap`) to stay out of the command-body
  preview as well as the description;
- agents already have a long body, so the marker sits at the very end.

The `Contains` ownership check is unchanged (it scans the whole file), so
overwrite-protection and old-format GC still work — only the UI is
cleaner.

Drive-by: fixed a pre-existing gofmt misalignment in the `atom` struct in
`models_atoms.go` (whitespace only).

Build / vet / gofmt clean; `./internal/cmd/...` and `./internal/agent/`
test suites green. The generated `.claude/**` files are gitignored — the
source of truth is the Go generator; run `crush claude-init` (`--global`
for `~/.claude/`) to refresh a workspace.

### Batch 32 — upstream triage v0.72.0 → v0.84.0, selective port (2026-07-10)

Triaged all 237 non-merge commits between the fork's last merge-base
(`61e40556`, v0.72.0) and upstream `origin/main` (`355fb647`, v0.84.0).
Full triage recorded in `docs/plans/2026-07-10-upstream-port-plan.md`.
Bucketed into: already covered by prior forks work (10 commits, verified
by reading the fork's code, not by commit title), ported this session (9
commits below), and ~210 SKIP (all TUI, the multi-client server model,
CLA bot noise, deps-only bumps, and upstream's own `internal/lock`
package — none apply, per the fork's OWNED/REMOVED tables in this file).

**Ported, one commit per upstream hash, cherry-picked-by-hand (not
`git cherry-pick` — the fork's `agent.go`/`coordinator.go`/`load.go` have
diverged too far for a literal patch to apply):**

- `21a457d5` → `fc55a67a` — malformed tool-call JSON is sanitized to `{}`
  before being persisted, with the matching tool result flipped to an
  explicit error. Previously a broken JSON tool-call from the model stuck
  a session forever (re-read from the DB every subsequent turn).
- `d3d68045` → `b353cf63` — `workaroundProviderMediaLimitations` now
  checks `CatwalkCfg.SupportsImages` before converting tool-result media
  into a `FilePart`; a text-only model no longer bricks on media it can't
  process.
- `1535ebb7` → `8e00fa59` — `configureSelectedModels` now resets
  `ReasoningEffort` to the newly selected model's own default instead of
  silently keeping the previous provider's effort level.
- `f75435a2` → `50d7034a` — `effectiveReasoningEffort()` falls back
  user-effort → model-default → first `ReasoningLevels` entry, applied
  everywhere `getProviderOptions` previously read
  `ModelCfg.ReasoningEffort` directly, **except** the fork's own ZAI/GLM
  mapping — deliberately left untouched in this port because wiring it in
  would flip Z.AI's default reasoning state, a real behavior change
  requiring its own sign-off (see next entry).
- Follow-up → `28ec4145` — asked the operator, got an explicit "yes, add
  an off switch, default to high": GLM via Z.AI now defaults to thinking
  enabled at `high` (Z.AI recommends max/high for coding; GLM-5.x only
  exposes high/max, no lower tier to "fall back" to). Explicit opt-out via
  `ReasoningEffort == "off"`, reachable today through the existing
  unvalidated `provider/model@effort` CLI syntax
  (`crush models use zai/glm-5.2@off <small>`).
- `188dea64` → `754f2075` — `fsext.DirTrim` took the first *byte* of a
  directory name when abbreviating a path, mangling Cyrillic/CJK/emoji
  names. Now takes the first grapheme cluster via
  `ansi.FirstGraphemeCluster` (no dependency bump — `x/ansi` was already
  pinned at a version that has it).
- `78a205cd` → `f3d98850` — `copilot.initiatorTransport.RoundTrip` now
  guards `req.Body == nil` (valid for GET) alongside the existing
  `== http.NoBody` check; ported byte-for-byte, confirmed identical to
  upstream by diff.
- `ebd845c0` → `e7a554ed` — every outbound LLM stream call in `agent.go`
  (`Run`, `runSummarize`, `runSummarizeSilent`, `generateTitle`) now
  sends a deterministic, opaque `x-session-id`/`x-session-affinity`
  header pair (`session.HashID`, xxh3) for provider-side cache affinity.
  Extended one call site beyond upstream's three (`runSummarizeSilent`,
  fork-specific) — safe to extend since the header is purely additive and
  doesn't change request semantics.
- `4be77c56` → `e519fa52` — provider warnings are now logged
  (`slog.Warn("Provider warning", ...)`). Adapted, not ported literally:
  upstream reads a `stepResult.Warnings` field that doesn't exist on the
  fork's pinned `fantasy v0.25.2`; used the equivalent `OnWarnings`
  callback instead.
- `c1a48226` → `5d3edc09` — new llama.cpp model enricher in
  `internal/discover/`, following the fork's `omlx.go` base-URL pattern
  (raw `cfg.BaseURL` + relative path) rather than upstream's literal path
  construction — the fork's `cfg.BaseURL` for OpenAI-compat providers
  already includes `/v1`, so upstream's approach would have produced
  `/v1/v1/models`.
- `363ffec9` → `4eca5d1b` — turned out to already be ported (`7372eecd`,
  predates this session); added the missing test coverage for
  `ProjectSkillsDir`'s git-worktree-root discovery.
- `6242e4f4` — also already ported before this session, verified present
  end-to-end (config field, `loadContextFiles` refactor, `PromptDat`
  field, and a fork-styled `<user_preferences>` template section, not a
  copy of upstream's markdown section) — no diff needed.

**EVAL wave verdicts** (full detail in the plan file, § Волна 5): two
real, non-urgent gaps identified for **future** follow-up, not ported in
this session — (1) `de679203`: the fork's disk-recheck heuristic in
`RefreshOAuthToken` covers most token-refresh races but lacks an
in-process `singleflight.Group`; (2) `67f50014`: the ripgrep-unavailable
glob fallback (`fsext.globWithDoubleStar`) follows symlinks and has no
per-call timeout, unlike the rg fast-path. Everything else in the EVAL
wave (401-retry centralization, child-process isolation, schema
reflection for provider options) was already covered by prior fork work;
provider-specific fixes for providers the fork doesn't use (baseten,
fireworks) or that require a fantasy/catwalk version bump (bedrock-eu,
gpt-5.6, alibaba-US) were left for a deliberate later decision.

Every commit above: `go build ./...` clean, tests for the touched
package(s) green, reviewed by an independent agent before landing (per
`docs/plans/2026-07-10-upstream-port-plan.md`'s stated process).

Files: too many to list per-commit here — see the individual commit
messages (`git log --oneline fc55a67a^..4eeb72c3`) and the plan file for
the full per-item detail.

### 2026-08-19 — two NO-GO reviews worked off (`638bc777` … `3486ee0d`)

Sixteen tasks from two independent release-readiness reviews of the same
21 commits. Both returned NO-GO; they agreed on the shape of what was
wrong and disagreed on severity, which is what made the pair useful —
each caught things the other could not. One reviewed dynamically, by
reverting production changes and running the tests; the other statically,
over the same range plus the surrounding paths.

**The six release blockers.**

- `638bc777` — `DrainSessionNow`, on losing the admission race to a
  same-pump background worker, set `drained=true` and polled until
  admission cleared without ever learning what that worker produced.
  "Admission cleared" was read as "a continuation completed here", true
  for one of five outcomes. `RunNonInteractive` turns `(true, nil)` into
  exit code 0 with a success envelope, so the other four surfaced to the
  operator as a finished run over work that had not run, was
  terminal-failed, or was never committed. Admission now publishes a done
  channel and the execution's actual outcome; `errNoExecutionAttempted`
  keeps a bare `nil` from meaning both "committed" and "never ran".
- `0cd26cb2` — `Message.CheckpointGeneration` was write-only, so a
  mid-stream message read back as generation 0 against a row carrying N,
  the conditional update matched nothing, and `Update` returned nil. An
  operator editing that message got `{"status":"ok"}` over an unchanged
  row. Hydrated on read; the four editing handlers additionally re-read
  and compare, but only when the message was mid-stream, because
  `Update`'s zero-rows-returns-nil contract exists for the checkpoint
  ticker and is pinned by a P0 test.
- `ccbd19ce` — sticky WebSocket events were queued after a replay of up
  to 2000 events into a 512-slot channel that nothing was draining, so
  they were dropped under exactly the traffic they exist to survive. The
  shipped test allocated a channel that could never fill. Sticky now goes
  first and never enters the replay ring at all, which also rules out a
  superseded copy arriving last and winning.
- `c4d61a2c` — two rename misses in `web/src/store.ts`, both invisible to
  `tsc` because the containers are `Record<string, …>`. One left the UI
  showing a stale model after "inherit"; the other made "send with fast
  model" send no override at all, so the message ran on the smart model.
- `9e1d2c60` — the rename's text sweep followed the compiler, so stale
  slot names survived wherever nothing compiles them: `--help` output
  that errors when copied, and — worst — the builtin `crush-config` skill
  and `crush_info.md`, which teach an agent to write a config the new
  code does not read. Plus a warning on an unrecognised key under
  `models`, and a mechanical guard so a third round cannot happen the
  same way.
- `f627cbac` — the orphan-outbox quarantine charged transient
  SQLITE_BUSY against the same five-attempt budget as a permanent
  failure, so lock contention could park healthy queued work at
  `status='failed'` forever. Its test never reached the production call
  site: deleting that call left the suite green.

**The rest.** `066ccb8f` watchdog disarmed on every exit rather than the
success path only, plus the outbox fallback given its own context budget
instead of the one the failed call had already exhausted. `d6fc736b` one
config snapshot threaded through agent construction and durable recovery,
so an agent can no longer be built from two generations. `9048e840`
`sessions kill` reaches the provider's process group on Unix — keyed by
the session lock's generation and validated against `/proc` start time
before signalling, because the first attempt would have `SIGKILL`ed
whatever had inherited a recycled PID. `7963750e` the ASCII/sqlc and
slot-name guards mirrored into CI, with a drift check pinned to sqlc
v1.30.0. `68d14a5e` the delegation transcript reported `(+2 lines)` for
every write — it was counting the result envelope's own newlines, not
anything about the file.

**Tests.** `22c6f767` + `0635c631` took the Playwright suite from 181
passing with a long red tail to **312 passed / 0 failed**. Most of the
tail was one fixture bug: `makeMessage()` defaults `SessionID` to
`"sess-1"` while `useWS.ts` correctly drops messages for other sessions,
so six spec files rendered an empty chat and timed out. Twenty-nine tests
were deleted as stale — LSP and permission-dialog UI that this fork
removed — each verified by grep first. `34f80494` fixed the one real UI
regression the triage exposed: `ChatToolbar` returned null without an
active session, which `89a07919` introduced while claiming no behaviour
change. `0bd25e3c` and `3486ee0d` fixed three flaky `internal/session`
tests, all the same shape: elapsed time used where a happens-before edge
belonged. Measured at eight concurrent `-race` runs, 15 failures became 0.

**Process note, because it is the reusable part.** Every fix above was
delegated, and **eight diffs were sent back after the orchestrator
verified them** — each time for a defect the agent's own report did not
mention. Three are worth naming: the first drain fix reused `nil` for
both "committed" and "never executed", recreating the P0 through a
different door; the first `sessions kill` registry `SIGKILL`ed
unvalidated PIDs read from a world-writable path, which is worse than the
leak it fixed; and the first CI guard step would have failed on every
clean run, because it was exercised under plain `bash` while Actions uses
`bash -eo pipefail`. All three passed their own tests and read as correct.

Four comments were also found asserting the opposite of what their code
did, and two claimed revert-checks they never performed.

### 2026-08-19 (later) — the third review worked off (`547b0815` … `61c481c6`)

A third static review landed on the sixteen commits above and returned
NO-GO again, with two release blockers **inside the outcome handoff that
had just been written to close the previous P0**. Both had been seen during
review of that commit and argued away — once because a different
execution's outcome is "still a real outcome", once because discarding an
accumulated error "mirrors pre-existing behaviour". Neither survives
contact with what the caller does: `RunNonInteractive` turns `(true, nil)`
into exit code 0.

- `b788eb01` — **admission ABA.** `admitSession` found the current holder's
  entry under the mutex when it refused, threw it away, and the drain
  re-read it in a second critical section. In between, the execution it
  lost to could finish and be replaced, so the drain waited on and reported
  a *different* execution's outcome. The refusal now returns the entry it
  lost to, read in the same critical section, and the second lookup is
  gone — reverting the fix no longer compiles, which is the point.
- `b788eb01` — **partial drain reported success.** `drained` is cumulative
  and both busy-return sites handed back `drained, nil`, so a stacked
  continuation where row A committed and row B then found the session owned
  elsewhere returned success with work still pending; when A had failed,
  its error was discarded too. Neither site discards an error now, and a
  still-nil error becomes `ErrDrainIncomplete` when an earlier row ran.
- `547b0815` — **editing a streaming message.** The review described a race
  with the checkpoint ticker. It is not a race: the terminal write at the
  end of every turn takes the unconditional branch — "terminal update
  always wins" — so an edit made mid-stream was overwritten every time,
  deterministically. Edits to a partial assistant message are refused, in
  the UI and independently in the handler. A CAS protocol was rejected with
  its cost written down: it needs the WS handler to signal the running turn
  goroutine, and it would have to weaken a contract the ticker depends on.
- `d3ee9841` — **outbox quarantine polarity inverted.** Only a proven
  permanent cause (`SQLITE_CONSTRAINT`) is charged; a `p.ctx` cancellation
  short-circuits before the recorder runs at all. Previously a plain
  `Stop()` mid-transaction, a slow disk, `IOERR`, `FULL` or any
  unrecognised wrapper counted against a five-attempt budget, so routine
  shutdowns could park accepted user work at `failed` forever.
- `d3ee9841` — the kill registry is written atomically (temp, fsync,
  rename) instead of truncate-and-write, and the sweep now retains entries
  whose outcome was inconclusive instead of deleting the only durable
  pointer after a failed `killpg`.
- `ff9efec1` — **sticky envelopes carry a sequence number**, so a
  superseded copy already sitting in the broadcast queue is dropped rather
  than delivered after the current one. The MCP half of the same finding
  went the other way deliberately: the registry holds live client sessions
  and server-pushed schemas, so it cannot be pinned to a config snapshot —
  the *claim* was narrowed instead, in `buildTools` and `GetMCPTools`.
- `61c481c6` — `internal/session` gated to `GOMAXPROCS/4` concurrent
  subtests. 79 parallel subtests, each with a one-connection SQLite DB, run
  eight-wide under `-race` starve each other badly enough that a
  lease-renewal goroutine missed a full 3s TTL and a row executed twice. No
  timeout or TTL was widened; measured 3 failures per 8 runs before, 1
  after — reported as 1, not 0.

**A correction to the entry above.** It claimed "15 failures became 0" for
the flake work at eight-way concurrency. That was a single sample. Measured
properly at the same commit without the patch: 12 failures across 8 runs;
with it, 3. The package is load-sensitive independently of any one change,
and which tests fail varies per run. The numbers in this entry are all
per-8-run counts from the same machine.

Verification at `61c481c6`: `go test ./...` clean, `GOOS=linux` and
`GOOS=darwin` builds clean, `go vet` clean apart from a pre-existing
`csync` finding, both pre-push guards clean, and the web e2e suite at
**314 passed / 0 failed**.

Still open and deliberately not chased: the five new Unix registry tests
cross-compile but have never been executed — they need a real Linux or
macOS run. And the dynamic release gate the review asks for (multi-process
inject/drain stress, repeated shutdown during an outbox transaction, a real
Unix process-tree kill) does not exist.

### 2026-08-20 — the fourth and fifth reviews, and the gate that finally ran

Two more independent reviews landed on the work above, both NO-GO, and
their blockers are closed in `537d93df` … `377e4b94`. The open items at
the end of the previous entry — "the Unix registry tests have never been
executed" and "the dynamic release gate does not exist" — are both closed
here, and closing them changed the conclusions.

- `344dd37c` — **`DrainSessionNow` returns a typed `DrainResult`
  (`NoWork/Complete/Partial/Failed`) built from a row-ID-keyed ledger.**
  This contract had been wrong four times running: `nil` meaning both
  "committed" and "never executed"; a busy second row after a successful
  first reporting success; a later row's clean Ack erasing an earlier row's
  terminal failure; and finally `(DrainFailed, nil)` still being
  expressible. Each fix closed one combination and left the neighbour open,
  because the whole session shared one flat `err` with no row identity
  anywhere. A failure can now only be cleared by naming its exact row.
  `RunNonInteractive`'s switch moved into `drainOutcomeError`, a pure
  function, and now asserts a non-nil error on `Partial`/`Failed` — the
  previous guard was on `Complete`, where `nil` is harmless, and absent
  where `nil` means exit 0 over work that did not run.
- `05a1708f`, `6fe0108b` — **the child-group sweep is fenced on the
  victim's generation, captured before ownership is released.** The fence
  existed but was read at sweep time, after the victim was dead and the
  lock free: on Unix that is precisely the window a new `crush run` uses to
  acquire the lock and register its own children, so the sweep signalled
  the *new* owner's process group and discarded the real victim's entries.
  The follow-up found the crash case reachable by nothing at all, and why a
  naive fix would not work: `TryAcquireSessionLock` overwrites the
  generation sidecar as part of acquiring, and `Release` clears it, so the
  dead holder's identity is destroyed by the act of probing for it. The
  read has to precede the acquire attempt. `reset --force` had the same
  hole and is fixed the same way.
- `537d93df` — **delete is guarded like edit was, and an orphan is
  rescued.** `547b0815` refused edits to a streaming message but left
  delete unguarded; the guard is now an atomic SQL predicate rather than a
  read-then-act pair, and `UpdateMessage` reports real rows-affected
  instead of a hardcoded 1, so a terminal write against a deleted row stops
  resurrecting it in the UI. Two consequences surfaced only by exercising
  it: `DeleteSessionMessages` was a fourth delete path, and `sessions reset
  --force` on a SIGKILLed session could never satisfy the predicate, so the
  wipe aborted half-done — deterministically, not as a race. And an orphan
  became undeletable by the operator while rerun got an escape hatch; both
  paths now use the same `IsSessionBusy` discriminator, fail-closed.
- `b6549640` — **the sticky channel became a coalescing wakeup.** Sequence
  suppression fixed the late-joining client and did nothing for one already
  connected: a full buffer dropped the newest envelope and the queued stale
  one was then correctly suppressed, so that client got neither. The
  channel now carries tokens only and the current envelope is read from the
  map at fan-out. `stickySeq` is gone — suppressing a superseded generation
  is structurally impossible rather than handled by a heuristic.
- `984b8cd9` — registry directory fsync after rename (the file's data was
  already durable; the rename was not), dead poll seam removed, two
  comments that outlived their code narrowed.
- `377e4b94` — **the fence suites now run in CI on Linux without
  `-short`.** This is the reason the gate's verdict is NO-GO: `-short`
  skips every test that spawns a real child, and a `!windows` build tag
  covers the rest, so the guards this entire effort produced ran on *no
  platform*. Five reviews said so; this is the first commit to fix it.

**The gate ran.** `docs/reviews/2026-08-20-dynamic-release-gate.md`, with
its driver scripts committed alongside. 3622 sub-tests without `-short` on
Linux; 15 rounds of six concurrent real `crush run` processes against one
session id, exactly one winner every round and every loser rejected busy
with a nonzero exit; 45 SIGKILLs aimed at outbox writes with no split write
seen — reported as 3 of 25 landing near the write boundary rather than
rounded up to "verified"; and a real Unix process-tree kill against a live
holder, a crashed holder, and a new owner racing in, executed for the first
time. One real defect: a session-*creation* race surfaces a raw SQLite
UNIQUE error instead of a busy message, 11% of invocations, safe but
misleading.

`docs/design/session-lifecycle.md` was written so the fifth round does not
happen. Its most useful section is the graveyard: all four drain defects,
why each looked correct when it shipped, and which test catches it now.

**On verification.** Eleven delegated diffs were sent back this round after
being checked, each for a defect its own report did not mention — including
three where the fix was correct but nothing pinned it: reverting the single
site the task existed for left the tree green. One diff contained a
*fabricated* `fsync(2)` citation supporting a correct change; a made-up
reference in a durability argument is worse than none, because the next
reader will trust it. The revert-check rule that caught most of this is
narrow and worth repeating: revert **one site at a time**. Reverting two
together proves the pair is covered, not either.

Verification at `377e4b94`: `go test ./...` clean on Windows; the new CI
command green on real Linux; Playwright **323 passed / 0 failed**.

Still open, filed rather than left in prose: the watchdog margin overshoot
at ~4 failures in 10 on Linux (`#604`, measured on native ext4 too, so not
a filesystem artifact); the session-creation UNIQUE race (`#605`); and two
kill tests that fail on Linux at any commit because their helper holder is
never reaped and lingers as a zombie (`#606`) — named explicitly in the new
CI step's exclusion list so a green run cannot be mistaken for coverage.
