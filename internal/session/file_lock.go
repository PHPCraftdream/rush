// FileLock is a generic exclusive lock on an arbitrary path on disk.
// Use AcquireFileLock for blocking acquisition (waits for the lock) or
// TryAcquireFileLock for non-blocking (returns immediately with an error
// if contended).
//
// Backed by the same OS primitives as SessionLock (flock on POSIX,
// LockFileEx on Windows). The lock is released automatically when the
// process dies; explicit Release closes the file handle.
//
// Use case (callers added 2026-05): the cliprovider qwen/gemini MCP-id
// files and their respective ~/.{qwen,gemini}/settings.json edits are
// read-modify-write across multiple rush processes that share a working
// directory or a home directory. Without a lock, two processes racing to
// generate the same MCP ID end up with split-brain (loser's in-memory
// ID points to no server) and concurrent settings.json edits clobber
// each other.

// Release unlocks and closes the lock file. Safe to call on nil.
//
// Deliberately does NOT os.Remove the sidecar file at l.Path — the lock file
// is left on disk permanently by design. Removing it here would race a
// concurrent process that acquires the lock (reopens/relocks the same path)
// between this unlock and the remove: on POSIX that race is harmless (flock
// is keyed off the inode, so unlinking the path doesn't disturb a
// still-open fd to the old inode), but on Windows it is not — the file is
// opened without FILE_SHARE_DELETE, so a concurrent holder's open handle
// would make the remove fail with a sharing violation, and even a
// successful delete risks a subsequent opener creating a distinct file
// object at the same path while an older one is still locked, which can
// reintroduce the exact split-brain this lock exists to prevent. Leaving a
// handful of empty *.lock sidecars on disk is a one-time, bounded cost;
// deleting them is not worth the cross-platform risk.
