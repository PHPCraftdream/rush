// P0-2 regression test for the orphaned-mailbox-work path
// (docs/reviews/2026-08-11-release-readiness-concurrency-and-code-review.md):
// restartOrphanedWithRetry's own doc comment claimed calls are "durably
// enqueued... BEFORE returning control", but the original implementation
// spawned an unwaited goroutine per call and returned immediately — a
// process crash between that return and the goroutine's actual DB commit
// would lose the call permanently, with no error ever surfacing anywhere.
//
// The fix made restartOrphanedWithRetry synchronous (via sync.WaitGroup)
// relative to its own caller and gave it an error return, propagated by
// restartOrphaned via slog.Error. This test proves both: the function
// actually WAITS for the enqueue attempt (a fast-failing DB doesn't let it
// return before the attempt is resolved) and it reports failure via its
// return value instead of swallowing it silently.
//
// It deliberately does NOT go through the full mailbox/drainOrRelease path
// (like TestP0_2_CrossProcessInterrupt_RowRecreatedOnFailure does for
// startDetachedRun) — restartOrphanedWithRetry is called directly, since
// it is what actually changed and the mailbox plumbing above it is already
// covered by this session's many prior mailbox regression tests.

// TestRestartOrphanedWithRetry_ReturnsErrorOnEnqueueFailure is the
// regression test for P0-2's orphaned-work path.
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE:
//  1. In agent.go's restartOrphanedWithRetry, change the signature back to
//     not return an error (drop `error` from the func signature and the
//     `return nil`/`return err` statements at the end), and have
//     restartOrphaned go back to calling it without checking a return value.
//  2. This test will fail to COMPILE (restartOrphanedWithRetry no longer
//     returns a value to assign to `err`) — a stronger signal than a
//     runtime failure, since Go's type system itself enforces the coupling
//     between this test and the fix.
//  3. Restore the error-returning signature and it compiles/passes again.
