// Test401Retry_RebuildsCallWithFreshCredentials is a regression test for
// P1-2: after a 401 credential refresh, the retry must rebuild the call
// with fresh credentials. The test verifies that:
// 1. First call fails with 401
// 2. Credentials are refreshed (generation increments, cache cleared)
// 3. Second call succeeds
//
// HONEST LIMITATION: mockSessionAgent.runFunc always succeeds on the second
// call regardless of which credentials/client were actually used, so this
// test cannot distinguish "retry used the fresh client" from "retry used
// the stale client and happened to succeed anyway" — it only proves the
// rebuild-and-retry flow completes without error, not that the specific
// stale-client bug is closed. A real client-identity check would need a
// fake provider client that tracks which token it was constructed with.
//
// REVERT CHECK (actually run, not just described): passing nil for
// rebuildCall at the runInternal call site does NOT fail this specific
// assertion — runWithUnauthorizedRetry used to call rebuildCall()
// unconditionally, so nil there panics with a nil pointer dereference
// instead (a real bug independently found and fixed during zero-trust
// review: the other two call sites of runWithUnauthorizedRetry legitimately
// pass nil and were panicking on any 401 that successfully refreshed
// credentials, on every run built from this diff before the guard below was
// added). runWithUnauthorizedRetry now nil-checks rebuildCall before
// calling it.
