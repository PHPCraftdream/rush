// The Unix registry behind KillAllTrackedTrees — the last-resort sweep that
// stands in for Windows' kill-on-close Job Object when crush is about to die
// without running its own cleanup.
//
// The property that matters most here is the NEGATIVE one: a pid that is not
// its own group leader must never be recorded. Sweeping it would mean
// kill(-pid) against whatever unrelated process group happens to carry that
// numeric id — including, on an unlucky day, crush's own.

// spawnGroupChild starts a long-lived child, optionally as its own process
// group leader, and returns it with a reaper already waiting.
