// TestMailbox_Invariant_NoStaleCancelHandleSurvivesAnyMutatorReturn is the
// mechanical, table-driven check rounds 12 and 13's independent reviews
// both recommended in place of further ad-hoc reading. Four rounds of
// human review (BLOCKER-2, round 9; MEDIUM-1, round 11's legacy-reclaim
// branch; finding A, round 12's mb.submitted branch; the fourth instance,
// round 13's drainAfterCancel branches) each found ONE more copy of the
// exact same postcondition violation, one branch at a time, because each
// round re-audited whichever function had most recently changed rather
// than enumerating every branch that can leave the mailbox owned.
//
// The invariant, stated once and checked everywhere: for every mailbox
// operation that hands "hasNext == true" (or the equivalent "still
// running, ownership continues") back to a turn loop, the postcondition
// MUST be state == mbOwned && current.cancel == nil && dispatcherCancel
// != nil. For every operation that ends an ownership era, the
// postcondition MUST be state == mbIdle && current.cancel == nil &&
// dispatcherCancel == nil. current.cancel must NEVER be left holding a
// handle from a generation that already ended — that's the shape every
// one of the four found bugs shared.
//
// Each table row starts from a mailbox that looks exactly like the state
// right after a turn's own genCtx cancel has already fired once (the real
// production shape at every one of these call sites: runTurn calls its
// own `cancel()` before reaching the final drain, and drainAfterCancel is
// only reached from the isCancelErr branch, i.e. after a cancellation
// already happened) — current.cancel is a closure that records if it's
// ever invoked AGAIN, which would mean a stale handle survived and got
// called by a later Cancel()/InterruptAndReplace() instead of the correct
// dispatcherCancel fallback.

		//
		// #307 (P1-2 follow-up) update: interruptAndReplace's OWNED branch
		// (state == mbOwned && !stopped) is also not added here, even though
		// it is no longer a pure early return — it records
		// mb.replacement and returns mb.current.cancel as-is (nil or
		// non-nil, whichever it already was). It still never WRITES to
		// state/current.cancel/dispatcherCancel, the three fields this
		// table's postcondition governs, so there is nothing for the
		// blanket "current.cancel must be nil" (or the mbOwned/mbIdle
		// dichotomy) to assert about it: it neither hands work back to a
		// turn loop (that's reclaimReplacementOrKeep's job, below) nor ends
		// an era. Covered directly instead by
		// TestMailbox_InterruptAndReplace_OwnedButNoLiveGeneration_RecordsReplacementWithoutDispatcherFallback
		// and TestMailbox_InterruptAndReplace_OwnedRecordsReplacementAndReturnsCurrentCancel
		// (mailbox_test.go), which assert its actual postcondition:
		// mb.replacement is set, and the returned cancel is exactly
		// mb.current.cancel (never a dispatcherCancel fallback — that
		// fallback is precisely what #307 removed, since dispatcherCancel
		// is runCancel and firing it poisons every future turn's context,
		// not just the possibly-nonexistent current generation).
		//
		// reclaimReplacementOrKeep is likewise NOT in this table, for the
		// same reason injectIfBusy already isn't (see that method's own
		// doc): it does not change ownership state at all — state, current,
		// and dispatcherCancel are all left untouched. Its job is choosing
		// WHICH SessionAgentCall the next generation runs (the loop's stale
		// `call` vs. a same-window mb.replacement), not deciding whether
		// the era continues or ends — that decision was already made by
		// whichever drain call produced `call` in the first place. On the
		// replacement-hit branch it also pushes the pre-empted `call` back
		// onto the FRONT of mb.submitted (closing review: an earlier draft
		// discarded it instead, the #283/P0-2 class of bug — "interrupt
		// deletes the very message it's supposed to queue behind"), but
		// mb.submitted's contents are not part of this table's ownership-
		// state postcondition either. Covered directly by
		// TestMailbox_ReclaimReplacementOrKeep_* (mailbox_test.go), including
		// the multi-element-queue case that specifically catches the discard
		// defect.

		// #296/P1-C, corrected per #297 review: drainOrReleaseFinal passes
		// THROUGH mbReleasing on its way to mbIdle — it NEVER re-emerges as
		// mbOwned once release() has been invoked, no matter what lands in
		// mb.submitted/mb.replacement during the window (see this function's
		// own doc: release() has already run, so there is no OS lock left to
		// keep a turn loop going under — an earlier draft of this fix handed
		// such work back as hasNext==true/mbOwned, which meant the turn loop
		// kept running turns with the session's OS lock already released,
		// letting a second process acquire the same lock concurrently).
		//
		// These three rows assert the CORRECTED contract: work that races
		// into the mailbox during the release() window always ends up in the
		// `orphaned` return value with the era ending at mbIdle, EXCEPT when
		// hardStop also landed in that same window, in which case it is
		// discarded (not orphaned) per hardStop's existing contract.
