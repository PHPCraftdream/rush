// Regression tests for task #341/P1-1: a config snapshot pinned at the start
// of a resolve/build operation must stay pinned through every read that
// operation makes, including reads made by helpers it calls into
// (workerSubAgentActive) and reads made later in the same logical operation
// (the 401 credential-refresh rebuild in runInternal).
//
// This is a direct follow-on to the P1-3 fix that made buildAgentModels take
// a single Snapshot() for its own three model lookups (smart/fast/worker):
// that fix missed that buildAgentModels' worker-preference branch calls
// workerSubAgentActive(), which independently re-read c.cfg.Config() live —
// so a reload landing between buildAgentModels' Snapshot() and the
// workerSubAgentActive() call could still hand back a worker slot from a
// DIFFERENT generation than the smart/fast models were built from.
// resolveSessionModels had the same shape of gap around its system-prompt
// build, and runInternal's 401 rebuildCall took a SECOND, separately-timed
// Snapshot() purely to look up provider config/options for a model that
// had already been resolved from an earlier snapshot.

// of two generations — e.g. ModelCfg.Provider/Model naming the Worker
// provider (decided from a later generation) while the client the model was
// actually built with (large.Model, resolved via largeProviderCfg.Models
// from an earlier or later generation than ModelCfg) came from a different

// toggling some fraction of calls observe the Snapshot()-time generation for
// smart/fast model selection but a DIFFERENT (later) generation for the
// worker gate — producing a large.ModelCfg.Provider that doesn't match
// either registered provider's expected model ID pairing, which this test's
// per-call shape assertion catches as a failure. With the fix restored,
