// trackedJob pairs a kill-on-close Job Object handle with the creation
// time of the process the job was created for. The creation time is the

// map key alone cannot prove an entry still refers to the process the
// caller means — two processes that successively held the same pid are
// told apart by when they were created.

// Job Object with JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE, so KillProcess
// can take the entire tree down with one TerminateJobObject call no
// matter what the PPID chain looks like.
//
// Why taskkill /T alone is not enough: under MSYS2/Git-Bash, spawning
// an external binary routes through a transient intermediary process,
// and the OS records that intermediary — already gone by inspection
// time — as the child's parent. The PPID walk taskkill /T performs
// therefore never reaches the grandchild; this was confirmed by direct
// wmic observation (10/10 deterministic survivor cases, see the comment
// on TestStreamKillUsesTreeKillStillTerminatesChild in
// internal/agent/cliprovider). Job membership, unlike the PPID chain,
// is inherited automatically by every descendant that does not
// explicitly break away, so the job kills the tree even when the
// parent chain is broken.
//
// The KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE limit doubles as a crash net: the handle is
// held open until the tree is terminated or UntrackProcessTree runs,
// so if rush itself dies without cleanup, the OS closes the handle
// and kills the tree anyway.
//
// Assigning a process that already belongs to another job fails on
// Windows versions without nested-job support (pre-Win8); the error is
// returned so callers can degrade to the taskkill path, preserving the
// pre-Job-Object behavior.

// of reporting success for a job that terminated nothing. That check
// cannot be skipped: TerminateJobObject on an empty job or on a job
