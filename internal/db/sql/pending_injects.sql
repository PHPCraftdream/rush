-- pending_injects is the cross-process inject queue for `rush sessions
-- inject`. See migration 20260703000001 for the full semantics.
--
-- NOTE: as of this fork the session-layer wrapper (session.go
-- DrainPendingInjects / CreatePendingInject) talks to this table via raw
-- database/sql, matching the existing cross-process signal pattern
-- (RequestCancel / SetBudget). These sqlc-generated methods below ARE
-- wired into db.go's Prepare/Close/WithTx (as of the sqlc regeneration
-- that added call_tree_activity.sql), but nothing in the codebase calls
-- them yet - session.go's raw-SQL path remains the actual implementation.
-- Keep both in sync if pending_injects' schema changes.

-- name: CreatePendingInject :exec
