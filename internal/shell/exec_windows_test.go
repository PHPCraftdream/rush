// cmd.Stdout/Stderr are plain io.Writers, os/exec backs them with an OS
// pipe whose copy-goroutine cmd.Wait() joins — that goroutine only sees EOF
// once every handle holder closes it. The still-alive grandchild (level 2)
// keeps its inherited copy of the handle open even after level 1 dies, so
// cmd.Wait() — and therefore execCommon/runner.Run, and therefore
// bgShell.done — never unblocks on its own; against the old code this test
// would hang for the grandchild's full sleep (60s) instead of returning
// promptly. This is exactly the failure mode observed in production: a
// job_kill call against a proxy process that had forked a worker blocked
// for the full 15-minute tool watchdog instead of returning immediately.

	// (non-tree-kill) implementation hangs on the grandchild's inherited
	// stdout/stderr handle regardless of how long level 1 itself would have
