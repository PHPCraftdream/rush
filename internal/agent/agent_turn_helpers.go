// drainDueInjects is PrepareStep's mailbox-inject drain (design §5, stage

// below was (task #243): a test must be able to drive the REAL production
// logic instead of a copy of it. The first version of this lived inline in
// the PrepareStep closure and its tests re-implemented the drain-and-dedup
// in a local helper — a mirror that passes whether or not production still
// matches it, which is exactly the shape #243 exists to stop.
//
// The rows are ALREADY in the DB (InjectMessage persisted them via
// createUserMessage), so callers only splice them into the current prompt —
// no second Create call.
//
// Two rules, one per half of P1-1:
//   - drainInjects(genID) returns only entries stamped at or before THIS
//     turn's generation, so an inject that landed after a previous turn's
//     last PrepareStep is picked up by this turn rather than stranded (the
//     LOSS half).
//   - historyIDs skips any inject whose row the preamble's
//     getSessionMessages already loaded, so a DB write that raced ahead of
//     the preamble does not appear both in history and in the splice (the
//     DUPLICATION half).

// handleWatchdogFire is runTurn's stream-watchdog onFire callback, pulled out
// into a named method (task #243) so a unit test can invoke the REAL
// production logic directly — constructing a minimal *sessionAgent and
// calling this method with a synthetic watchdogCauseVal — instead of only
// exercising a test-local copy of this shape that could silently drift from
// what runTurn actually wires up. The onFire closure inside runTurn is now
// just a thin dispatch: `func(elapsed, cause) { a.handleWatchdogFire(...) }`.
//
// watchdogCauseVal is runTurn's local atomic.Int32 (not a sessionAgent
// field: it is genuinely per-turn state, reset fresh on every call), passed
// in by pointer so this method can store into the caller's copy.
// toolMaxDuration/idleTimeout are likewise runTurn locals (the resolved,
// possibly-overridden effective durations for THIS turn) rather than
// sessionAgent fields, so they are passed explicitly instead of read off a.
// smartModel follows the same rule, and then some: runTurn does NOT re-read
// a.smartModel here at fire time — it passes in the value it took once,
// before the turn, from the immutable turnConfig snapshot built by
// resolveTurnConfig (agent.go:302-308), a per-call value copy of every
// shared model/prompt field (task #265 P0-1) that runTurn reads as
// `smartModel := cfg.smartModel`. a.smartModel is mutable mid-turn via
// SetModels (coordinator.UpdateModels / web-UI override path), so
// re-reading at fire time would name the model the user SWITCHED TO after
// the hang started rather than the one that actually hung (task #252 —
// the #243 extraction regressed exactly this by re-reading a.smartModel
// here).
//
// INVARIANT (task #227 + #232, preserved verbatim by this extraction): the
// cause is stored FIRST, synchronously, before any other work in this
// method. startStreamWatchdog invokes onFire strictly before cancel(), so
// whatever this method does before returning is on the critical path to
// unblocking agent.Stream. If the OUTER ctx is also cancelled independently
// of this watchdog (Ctrl-C, a --timeout firing at the same moment) while
// this method is still running, the main goroutine reading watchdogCauseVal
// after observing stalled==true must never see the zero value
// (causeIdleStall) for what was actually a hard-cap/tool-timeout fire — that
// would misreport the cause via a DIFFERENT race than the one #227 fixed
// (external cancellation racing this callback, rather than this callback
// racing its own cancel()).

	// debugger attach yields nothing and merely kills the process). Without
	// this, every production hang is diagnosed by guesswork.

	// CaptureGoroutineStack does no I/O — it's runtime.Stack plus a string

	// actual moment of the hang. Capturing it from an async goroutine
	// instead (as an earlier version of this fix did) would let it run
	// AFTER cancel()/unwind had already started — or, if the process exited

	// directory sits on a stuck network/SMB mount) would mean cancel()
	// never runs, agent.Stream never unblocks, and runTurn's deferred
	// <-wd.done blocks forever — a full process freeze, exactly the failure
	// mode this watchdog exists to prevent. The dump is best-effort
