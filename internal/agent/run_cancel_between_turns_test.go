// blockingSecondGetSessionService's Get blocks only on calls made with a
// context that has a deadline — i.e. runTurn's preambleCtx
// (context.WithTimeout(ctx, sessionPreambleMaxDuration)), the ONLY call site
// among the several a.sessions.Get call sites in agent.go that carries a
// deadline. Every other call site (OnStepFinish's mid-turn re-fetch, the
// summarize helpers, etc.) derives its ctx from genCtx via plain
// context.WithCancel with no deadline, so those pass through untouched.
// This matters because runTurn calls a.sessions.Get more than once per
// call to Run — critically, OnStepFinish (agent.go ~1712) re-fetches the
// session once per completed step, which already happens during turn 1
// itself. A naive "block on the 2nd call overall" counter would trip
// inside turn 1's own OnStepFinish instead of turn 2's DB preamble, which
// is useless for this test: pinning down the preambleCtx deadline is what
// actually isolates "a turn's DB preamble" calls from every other Get call.
//
// The first preamble call (turn 1's own) passes through untouched — turn 1
// must complete normally so a second, queue-drained turn actually starts.
// The second preamble call (turn 2's) blocks and signals entered once,
// pinning down the exact window task #206 is about: after turn 1 has fully
// returned (its own per-turn `cancel` already spent) and before turn 2's
// runTurn has reached its own `a.activeRequests.Set(call.SessionID,
// cancel)` — i.e. while activeRequests still holds whatever Run's turn
// loop set it to.

// TestRun_CancelDuringSecondTurnPreamble_ActuallyCancels is the regression
// test for task #206: the turn loop in Run() only registered runCancel (the
// whole-call CancelFunc tryReserveSession stores in activeRequests) once,
// before the loop started. runTurn itself later overwrites that map entry
// with its own per-turn `cancel` (derived from runCtx) partway through the
// turn — but once that turn returns, its `cancel` has already been invoked
// via defer and is dead. From the moment one turn returns until the next
// queue-drained turn's runTurn reaches its own activeRequests.Set — i.e.
// for the whole of the next turn's DB preamble, bounded by
// sessionPreambleMaxDuration — activeRequests pointed at that dead
// placeholder. A Cancel(sessionID) landing in that window found the dead
// func, called it, and nothing happened: the turn that was actually
// executing (stuck in its DB preamble) kept right on going, exactly the
// "dead placeholder silently no-op'ing" tryReserveSession's own doc comment
// says must not happen.
//
// This test drives Run() through two turns via the same queue-drain path
// TestRun_QueueDrain_DoesNotDeadlockOnOwnSessionLock uses (second message
// queued mid-stream, after PrepareStep's TakeAll for turn 1, so it runs as
// a genuinely separate turn 2 through the same loop rather than being
// folded into turn 1's own prompt). A fake session.Service blocks turn 2's
// DB preamble (its second Get call) and signals entered the moment it does
// — i.e. exactly inside the window described above, before turn 2's runTurn
// has replaced the map entry with its own live cancel func. From there the
// test calls the public Cancel(sessionID) and asserts Run() actually
// returns with a cancellation-shaped error instead of hanging or
// completing normally, proving the registered CancelFunc was live (and
// therefore actually interrupted turn 2's preamble) rather than a spent
// no-op.
