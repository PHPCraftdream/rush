# Crush

**Crush is a coding agent you run from the command line — but built
to be driven by *other* AI agents, not by a human typing into a
terminal.** Point an orchestrator (Claude Code, your own LLM wrapper,
a CI pipeline, a multi-agent fleet) at `crush run`, and it gets a
model-agnostic, wrapper-stable JSON envelope back: one process it can
spawn any number of times in parallel against the same repository
without the instances corrupting each other's state.

- **npm package:** [`@phpcraftdream/crush`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phpcraftdream/crush)
- **Source:** [github.com/PHPCraftdream/crush](https://github.com/PHPCraftdream/crush)

```bash
npm install -g @phpcraftdream/crush
crush run --role smart "summarize what this repo does"
```

## What is this, and why

Most coding-agent CLIs are built for a human sitting in a terminal,
reading streamed output and clicking through permission prompts. This
one is built for the opposite case: **something else is the operator**
— another LLM, a script, a CI job — and it needs a subprocess it can
call over and over, unattended, and trust the output of.

Typical ways people actually use it:

- **Claude Code (or any other agent) delegating sub-tasks.** The
  top-level agent hits a chunk of work that's cheap, mechanical, or
  just doesn't need its own context window — it shells out to
  `crush run`, gets a JSON envelope back, and keeps going. See the
  `/crush` skill shipped with this fork for the exact pattern.
- **Fan-out over a codebase.** Five, ten, fifty `crush run` invocations
  against the same `.crush/` directory at once — each one a separate
  session, each one safe from the others' writes (SQLite, file locks,
  cost accounting are all defended for exactly this).
- **CI pipelines that need an LLM step.** A build step that asks a
  model to review a diff, write a migration, or fix a failing test —
  and needs a predictable exit code and a parseable result, not a
  chat transcript to eyeball.
- **Headless automation on a schedule.** Cron jobs, webhooks, queue
  workers — anything that needs "run this prompt against this repo and
  tell me what happened" as a function call, not an interactive
  session.
- **A human who still wants to look in.** The React/Tailwind web UI
  covers that case, but it's the second-class entry point here — the
  CLI and its JSON contract are what this project is actually built
  around.

If what you actually want is a polished terminal UI for a human to
chat with an agent in, that's [upstream `charmbracelet/crush`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush)
— this repository started as a fork of it and has since diverged
substantially in that direction (no TUI, no upstream server model,
different provider/session engine). See `CHANGELOG.fork.md` for the
full list of what changed and why.

## What this fork actually is

The product is **`crush` as an agent's hands**, not as a human's coding
companion. Every divergence below follows from that single repositioning:

- The TUI is gone — a human is no longer the primary user of the
  process. A React/Tailwind **web UI** stays for the cases where a
  human DOES want to look in, but the design centre is the CLI.
- The CLI is the contract. `crush run` exposes a **wrapper-stable JSON
  envelope** with a small, frozen set of fields an orchestrator parses
  without surprises. New flags (`--role`, `--session`, `--format`,
  `--agents`, `--timeout`, …) all exist to give the upper LLM precise
  control over a delegated turn.
- Multiple instances are a first-class concern. Five `crush run` against
  one `.crush/` directory cannot corrupt each other's state — sessions,
  cost accounting, log writes, MCP-id files and SQLite are all
  defended explicitly.
- Honest error reporting. When the model fails its contract (returns
  invalid JSON, runs out of context, stalls the stream) the envelope
  says so — there is no silent success because the agent on top
  cannot read the operator's mind.
- Bootstrap helper (`crush claude-init`) installs a `/crush` slash command into
  the workspace so the upper LLM knows when and how to delegate to
  `crush run` instead of grepping the codebase itself.

The browser UI is the second-class entry point for humans peeking in,
the orchestrator-facing CLI is first-class.

| Area | Upstream | This fork |
| ---- | -------- | --------- |
| Primary user | Human in a terminal | Another agent (LLM, CI, orchestrator) calling the CLI |
| Front-end | Bubble Tea TUI (~495 files under `internal/ui/`) | React/Tailwind SPA in `web/`, embedded via `go:embed`. Optional. |
| Transport | REST `/v1/...` over Unix socket / Windows named pipe | WebSocket `/ws` over TCP loopback (single embedded server) |
| Auth | None (local-socket trust) | Token-based, see `internal/server/auth.go` |
| Sessions | One model per agent role, set globally | Per-session model overrides + per-session system prompt, all persisted in SQLite |
| Permissions | In-memory rules during a TUI run | Persistent per-session rules in SQLite; cross-process visible |
| Parallel runs | Not a target | First-class — flock per session, OS-level lock release on crash, atomic file writes, additive cost SQL, MCP-id flock |
| `crush run` | Single-shot quick fire | Wrapper-friendly: `--role`, `--session` get-or-create, `--json`/`--format`/`--agents`/`--timeout`/`--stream`, JSON-envelope validation, `assistant_notes`, fallback error messages |
| CLI providers | Limited bridge | npx Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, MCP bridge for external tools, session resume for Anthropic prompt caching; Haiku available as `local-cli/cli-claude-haiku` (200k ctx, `@low\|medium\|high` effort) |
| Web UI features | n/a | Slash-command + skill autocomplete, dark/light theme, pinned messages, fork-session button, LSP/MCP/provider management modals, file/image attachments |

The full per-file decision log lives in [`CHANGELOG.fork.md`](./CHANGELOG.fork.md).
That document is also the survival guide for merging upstream `main`
into the fork — every divergence is annotated with a `// Fork patch:`
comment in the code so conflicts surface at the right line.

## Security — `crush run` has no permission gating at all

**`crush run` (the non-interactive CLI mode this fork is built around)
auto-approves every tool call — bash, write, edit, fetch, everything.**
There is no dialog, no allow/deny prompt, no toggle to turn this off:
it is how non-interactive mode works by design, because there is no
human on the keyboard to click Allow. The model has the same file and
process access as the OS user running `crush`.

This is **not** the old per-session "YOLO" toggle (that UI feature has
been removed entirely — see `CHANGELOG.fork.md`). It is unconditional
for every `crush run` invocation, with no flag to restore per-request
prompting. The interactive web UI (`crush web`) is different: it still
shows a permission dialog (Allow / Deny / Allow-always) for each tool
call unless the operator clicks through it manually.

**Run `crush run` inside an isolated environment — Docker, Podman, a
VM, or at minimum an OS-level sandbox/dedicated worktree** — whenever
the prompt or the repository content is not fully trusted, or when
model-written code will execute. Do not point it at a host you can't
afford to have fully modified. See `--cwd` and `CRUSH_FORBID_WRITES`
below for lighter-weight mitigations when a full container isn't
practical, but they are not a substitute for real isolation — they
only block specific tool-call targets, not arbitrary shell execution.

## Running Crush in this fork

Two complementary entry points; pick whichever fits the job.

### 1. `crush web` — the browser UI

```bash
crush web                            # default port + open browser
crush web --port 8080 --no-open      # for a remote workstation
```

A long-lived process. Sessions live in `.crush/crush.db`, the UI loads
the React bundle from inside the binary, the WebSocket is local-only +
token-authed. This replaces upstream's TUI.

### 2. `crush run` — the orchestration CLI (the main thing)

The canonical pattern an orchestrator should be writing:

```bash
out=/tmp/audit-A.json
CRUSH_FORBID_WRITES="$out" \
  crush run --role smart --session "audit-A" \
            --json --format json --timeout 10m \
            < /tmp/audit-A.prompt > "$out" 2>"$out.err"
jq -r '.exit_reason' "$out"   # "end_turn" on success, "invalid_json" if model broke contract, "error" otherwise
jq -r '.final_text'   "$out"  # the raw JSON the model produced (validated)
jq -r '.assistant_notes' "$out" # any prose preamble that was stripped
jq -r '.error' "$out"         # error.message if non-success
```

#### Flags

- **`--role` (required)** — four slots exist: `smart`/`large` (the
  strong default; combined with a configured worker model this also
  triggers orchestrator mode — see below), `fast`/`small` (the cheap
  slot), `worker` (optional, no alias, cheap slot for delegated
  hands-on sub-task work — reachable directly via `--role worker`, or
  indirectly when a worker is configured and a `--role smart` run
  dispatches a sub-agent via the `agent` tool), and `reviewer`
  (optional, no alias, the strongest slot, for explicit review
  invocations — never auto-selected). `worker`/`reviewer` are
  configured via the web UI or `crush.json`'s `models.worker` /
  `models.reviewer` (`crush models use` manages smart/fast; see
  `--worker`/`--reviewer` flags below for the other two). No silent
  default to the expensive model either way.
- **`--session <id>`** — get-or-create. Pass the same id again to
  continue, or a new id to start fresh. Works as a stable key for CI
  matrices and orchestrator wrappers.
- **`--json`** — emits a single wrapper-stable envelope on stdout:
  `{session_id, exit_reason, final_text, assistant_notes, stripped_bytes,
  tool_calls, usage, duration_ms, error, warnings}`.
- **`--format json | json-schema:<f> | @<f> | <any text>`** — appends a
  per-turn output-shape hint to the prompt AND post-validates `final_text`.
  With `json` or `json-schema:`, the envelope is also post-processed:
  markdown fences and prose preamble are stripped; `json.Valid` runs on
  what remains. **If the model returns syntactically broken JSON**
  (e.g. forgot a `]` somewhere), `exit_reason="invalid_json"` is set,
  the original (unstripped) text is preserved in `final_text`, the
  failed strip attempt goes to `assistant_notes`, and `error` carries
  a `json.SyntaxError` with a byte offset. Wrappers can branch on
  `exit_reason` instead of trusting the model's optimistic `"stop"`.
- **`--agents single | with-agents | agent-allow`** — sub-agent fan-out
  policy. Leaving the flag **unset is the default and disables
  fan-out** — the `agent` and `agentic_fetch` tools are removed from
  the toolset entirely, same as passing `single` explicitly (a
  non-interactive run has no UI to surface sub-agent work). `with-agents`
  nudges the model to fan out. `agent-allow` opts in without a nudge,
  leaving the choice to the model. **Automatic exception:** when
  `--agents` is left unset (not explicitly `single`) AND `--role smart`
  AND a `worker` model is configured, the ban on the `agent` tool
  specifically is lifted automatically — this is "orchestrator mode"
  (see below); `agentic_fetch` stays banned regardless, since it always
  runs on the small model and isn't part of hands-on delegation. An
  explicit `--agents single` always overrides this and keeps both tools
  banned.
- **`--aggregation summary | concat | attach`** — how sub-agent fan-out
  output reaches the orchestrator. `summary` (default) lets the parent
  compose a wrap-up; detail lives in the DB only. `concat` adds a
  prompt nudge so the parent includes each sub-agent's reply verbatim
  in `final_text`. `attach` collects each sub-agent's last assistant
  text into `envelope.sub_agent_outputs` so the orchestrator gets the
  structured set; `final_text` becomes a brief wrap-up. An always-on
  warning fires in `envelope.warnings` when parent collapses sub-agent
  outputs to <40% of their combined character count, regardless of
  which mode is in use.
- **`--timeout <duration>`** — hard wall-clock cap; the partial answer
  is preserved in the session and surfaced in the envelope.
- **`--timeout-extends-on-progress`** — when set, the stream watchdog
  resets its idle deadline every time streaming activity occurs, so
  long compositions (code generation, multi-section reports) are not
  killed prematurely. Capped by `--timeout-hard-cap` if set.
- **`--timeout-hard-cap <duration>`** — maximum wall-clock time the
  watchdog will allow even with `--timeout-extends-on-progress`.
  Without a cap a continuously-streaming response runs forever.
  Typically set to 3–4× the idle timeout.
- **`--allow-peak-hours`** — bypasses a provider's configured
  `peak_hours` refusal window for this single invocation only. No
  persistent config-level equivalent exists; the override is conscious
  and one-off by design. **Never add this flag on an orchestrating
  agent's own initiative** — only when a human operator has explicitly
  asked, in that specific request, to override peak hours.
- **`--system-prompt[-file]`** — persists onto the session so follow-up
  runs inherit it.
- **`--stream`** — streams every token to stdout for live wrappers.

#### Envelope fields worth knowing

- `stripped_bytes` — how many bytes were removed from `final_text` by
  the JSON stripper (when `--json`+`--format json` were active). Graph
  it across runs to track how often your model wraps in prose.
- `tool_calls: [{name, count}]` — post-hoc inventory of what tools the
  model actually used. Useful to verify `--agents single` actually
  blocked fan-out.
- `sub_agent_outputs[]` — present only with `--aggregation attach`.
  Each entry is `{session_id, title, final_text, char_count}` for one
  sub-session the parent's `agent` tool dispatched during this run.
- `warnings[]` — non-fatal observations. Includes `final_text appears
  truncated` when the run errored mid-composition (so the operator
  sees the model was about to continue); `final_text is empty after N
  sub-agent fan-out call(s)` when the model dispatched sub-agents but
  never composed a top-level reply; and `reduction-loss: final_text
  is X% of N combined sub-agent chars` when the parent over-summarised
  (re-run with `--aggregation=attach` or `concat` to recover).
- `error` — present whenever `exit_reason` is non-success. If the
  provider's Finish part had no message (some providers emit a bare
  error finish), a fallback names the most likely causes (provider
  HTTP error, stream stall, OOM, context overflow). One `exit_reason`
  value is a **deliberate stop, not a failure**: `"awaiting_answer"`,
  set when the model called `ask_question` — see below.
- `recovered_partial` — present when the session had an orphaned
  partial assistant message from a previous interrupted run (detected
  by `Finish{Partial: true}` on an unfinished row). Shape:
  `{message_id, chars, last_flush_at, text}`. An always-on WARN in
  `warnings[]` fires when this field is populated: *"recovered N chars
  of partial assistant text — model run was interrupted"*. The text
  may be incomplete but is usually the bulk of what the model produced
  before the kill.

#### Pausing mid-turn: `ask_question` and orchestrator mode

The model has an `ask_question` tool it can call when it genuinely
needs input to proceed (ambiguous scope, a destructive choice, missing
info) instead of guessing. Because `crush run` has no synchronous way
to block mid-turn for an answer, calling it **force-finishes the turn
cleanly**:

```bash
crush run --role smart --session "deploy-1" "deploy the release" > out.json
jq -r '.exit_reason' out.json   # "awaiting_answer"
jq -r '.error'       out.json   # question + suggested options + resume command
```

- `exit_reason: "awaiting_answer"` is **not a failure** — treat it like
  a normal continuation point, not something to retry.
- The question, suggested options, and the exact resume command live in
  `.error` (not `.final_text`).
- Resume with `crush run --session <id> "<your answer>"` — **not**
  `crush sessions inject`, since the process already exited.

**Orchestrator mode:** when `--role smart` is used and a `worker` model
is configured, the smart agent's system prompt gains an "Orchestrator
mode" instruction: understand the task's shape, but delegate hands-on
work (editing, writing, running commands) to the `agent` tool in
worker-context-sized chunks instead of implementing inline — one file
or logical change per delegation, with enough standalone context since
the worker doesn't see the parent conversation.

A worker sub-agent can itself call `ask_question` and pause. That
does **not** end the orchestrator's turn (unlike the top-level case
above) — it surfaces as a normal, non-error tool result along the
lines of `SUB-AGENT QUESTION (session <id>): <question>`. The
orchestrator answers by calling the `agent` tool again with
`resume_session_id="<id>"` and the answer as the prompt, continuing
the same sub-session instead of starting a fresh one.

#### Env-vars to know

- **`CRUSH_FORBID_WRITES`** — comma-separated paths the `write`/`edit`/
  `multiedit` tools must NOT touch. **Set this to the stdout-redirect
  target before every `crush run`** — otherwise the model can pick the
  same filename it sees in the prompt and overwrite your envelope
  output. Tool calls to forbidden paths fail visibly to the model;
  it then falls back to returning content via `final_text`.
- **`CRUSH_PROVIDER_CACHE_TTL`** — duration (`24h` default, `0s` to
  always refresh). Caches the Catwalk/Hyper provider catalog locally
  so `crush models show` and similar read-only commands skip the
  ~3-second HTTP round-trip when the on-disk cache is fresher than
  the TTL.
- **`CRUSH_COLOR_SCHEME`** — `light` \| `dark` \| `auto` (default
  `auto`). Forces the CLI help/error color palette onto a light or
  dark background, working around unreliable terminal light/dark
  auto-detection. The auto path queries the terminal's background
  color with an OSC 11 escape sequence and a hard 2-second timeout;
  if the terminal doesn't reply in time (or stdin/stdout aren't both
  real TTYs, e.g. when an orchestrator spawns `crush` with redirected
  stdin), lipgloss's `HasDarkBackground` **falls back to assuming a
  dark background** — so on a light-themed terminal the help renders
  grey-on-white with low contrast. This has been reported on WezTerm
  on Windows. Set `CRUSH_COLOR_SCHEME=light` (or pass
  `--color-scheme light`, which is global and wins over the env var)
  to force the light palette.
  > **Windows gotcha:** `setx CRUSH_COLOR_SCHEME light` only writes the
  > variable to the registry for *future* processes — it does **not**
  > update any terminal window that's already open. Open a new
  > terminal tab/window (or restart the shell) before checking whether
  > it took effect, or you'll see the old behavior and wrongly
  > conclude the flag doesn't work.

Permissions are unconditionally auto-approved in `crush run` — see
"Security" above. `--cwd /tmp/sandbox` or a worktree narrows the blast
radius somewhat, but a container (Docker/Podman) or VM is the only
real isolation boundary; use it whenever the prompt or repo content
isn't fully trusted.

### 3. Parallel processes against one `.crush/`

The fork explicitly supports running 5+ `crush run --session X` against
the same working directory concurrently (the canonical use case is
multi-section code audits). The defence layers:

- Per-session OS flock (`internal/session/lock.go`) — two processes
  cannot share a session id.
- SQLite WAL + `busy_timeout=30000` + single-writer-per-process
  connection pool.
- Cost mutations go through additive SQL (`IncrementSessionCost`) so
  concurrent sub-agent goroutines AND parallel processes cannot lose
  cost via read-modify-write.
- Atomic file writes (`fsext.AtomicWriteFile`) in `write`/`edit`/
  `multiedit` tools — `kill -9` mid-write cannot truncate the user's
  file.
- Per-process `pid=N` attribute in every log line — interleaved Windows
  log writes can be split post-hoc with `jq 'select(.pid==N)'`.
- Permission grants ("Always allow") are DB-direct on every check, so
  a grant made in process A is immediately visible in process B
  without restart.
- MCP `qwen/gemini-mcp-id` and `~/.{qwen,gemini}/settings.json` writes
  are flock'd with a 30s timeout so a wedged sibling cannot freeze
  the fleet.

See [`CHANGELOG.fork.md`](./CHANGELOG.fork.md) Section 4.I for the full
parallel-process audit and the trade-offs we explicitly kept (e.g. N
processes still spawn N stdio children of every configured MCP server
— use HTTP/SSE-transport MCPs in parallel runs).

#### Injecting a message into a running session from another process

```bash
crush sessions inject <session-id> -m "also update the changelog"
crush sessions inject <session-id> -f ./notes/next-step.md
crush sessions inject <session-id> -m "stop, wrong approach" --interrupt
crush sessions inject 8a3f0c -m "continue" --json
```

Use this when a `crush run --session X` you already launched (from an
orchestrator, another terminal, or a `/crush` sub-agent) is mid-turn
and you want to hand it new information without killing it. `<id>`
accepts a full session id or the short hash printed by `sessions
list`.

- The message is persisted immediately as a normal user message —
  Role `user`, same as if it were typed — so it renders in the web UI
  exactly like anything the operator sends themselves.
- By default (no `--interrupt`) it merges into the session's next
  provider request without cancelling the in-flight turn — same
  latency as the web UI's non-stopping inject.
- With `--interrupt` the running turn is cancelled and immediately
  restarted with the new message, mirroring the web UI's
  interrupt-and-send.
- If no process is currently running the session, the message is
  still persisted and picked up the next time the session runs; the
  command tells you so instead of failing.

Delivery costs nothing at rest: `crush sessions inject` writes a
signal row to a `pending_injects` table, and the running process only
checks it at points it already visits on every turn (next provider
step for the merge case, a lightweight 3s ticker bound to the active
turn for `--interrupt`) — no standing poll loop, no open port.

### 4. Token & prompt-cache statistics

Every assistant message records its own token accounting, so you can ask
how much a model actually cost and how well the prompt cache is working:

```bash
crush sessions cache <session-id>          # one session, per model
crush sessions cache --by model            # every session, per model
crush sessions cache --since 7d --by day   # last week, day by day
crush sessions cache --since 30d --json    # machine-readable
```

Tokens are split into three **disjoint** classes, so the prompt size is
their sum: `INPUT` (fresh, full price), `READ` (served from the
provider's prompt cache, much cheaper) and `WRITE` (written into the
cache). `HIT` is `read / (input + read + write)`.

Grouping is by the model that **actually produced** each message, so a
session that switched models mid-conversation is split correctly. That
is the difference from `crush sessions cost`, which groups by the
session's *current* model and whose `TOKENS` column sums last-snapshot
session counters rather than real totals — the two read different
sources and are deliberately not merged into one table.

The output refuses to state numbers it cannot back up: `HIT` prints
`n/a` rather than `0%` when a provider does not report caching (a
fabricated zero is indistinguishable from a real miss), every table
reports its **coverage** when some messages have no usage recorded, and
`--by day` omits `HIT` entirely because a day can span providers whose
cache visibility differs.

### 5. Bootstrap helpers for an orchestrator

If you drive Crush from another LLM (e.g. Claude Code), run once:

```bash
crush claude-init                 # install the /crush slash-command
```

This installs **only** the `.claude/commands/crush.md` slash-command — an
operator-triggered `/crush <task>` that builds a `crush run` invocation
with sensible defaults and launches it. Triggered explicitly by the
operator; never auto-discovered.

Earlier versions of this fork also wrote a long "delegate everything to
crush" block into `CLAUDE.md`. That block turned out to be a recursive-
delegation footgun: a sub-agent reading it on startup would try to
delegate every task back into `crush run`, spawning another sub-agent
which read the same block, and so on (see CHANGELOG.fork.md batch 22 for
the postmortem). `claude-init` now strips that legacy block on every
invocation (matching any version, v1..vN) and removes `CLAUDE.md`
entirely if stripping leaves it empty. Re-run `claude-init` at any time
— it's idempotent.

To uninstall completely: `crush claude-del` removes the slash-command
file and strips any remaining legacy `CLAUDE.md` block.

### 6. `crush models` — picking and inspecting models

Four model slots exist: `large`/`small` (the smart/fast pair every
`crush run` uses by default) plus two optional ones, `worker` (cheap
slot for delegated sub-task work — see orchestrator mode above) and
`reviewer` (strongest slot, explicit-only). Commands covering the surface:

```bash
crush models list             # show available atoms + raw provider/model ids (reads cache; no network)
crush models list --refresh   # force a network refresh of provider data before listing
crush models use <large> <small> [--worker <atom>] [--reviewer <atom>] [--global | --local]
crush models use --small <atom>   # set just one slot — --large/--small/--worker/--reviewer are all independent
crush models state             # what's effective + per-scope breakdown (alias: `show`)
crush models efforts [model]   # explain reasoning-effort levels and how to set them
crush models bump <role> up|down  # step a role's effort by one level
crush models unset [large|small|worker|reviewer|both|all] [--global|--local]
```

> **No side effects by default:** `crush models list` reads the on-disk
> provider cache (or the embedded provider list bundled with Crush when
> no cache exists yet) and does NOT trigger a network fetch or write any
> cache files. Pass `--refresh` to force a fresh fetch from Catwalk and
> Hyper before rendering. The output shape (text and `--json`) is
> identical in both modes.

**Atoms** are short, friendly aliases. `list` prints them filtered by your
currently-enabled providers — disabled providers' atoms are hidden so the
list only shows what actually works right now:

```
ATOMS (combine as `crush models use <large> <small>`):

  Anthropic:
    via local `claude` CLI
    opus-low, opus-medium, opus-high, opus-xhigh, opus-max            Claude Opus    (1M ctx)
    sonnet-low, sonnet-medium, sonnet-high, sonnet-xhigh, sonnet-max  Claude Sonnet  (1M ctx)
    haiku-low, haiku-medium, haiku-high, haiku-xhigh, haiku-max       Claude Haiku   (200k ctx)

  Zai:
    glm5_3        GLM 5.3      (1M ctx)
    glm5_turbo    GLM 5 turbo  (200k ctx)
    ...
```

Anthropic atoms require a level suffix (`opus-high`, `sonnet-low`, etc.) —
the level list comes from parsing `claude --help` at first use (falls back
to a static `low/medium/high/xhigh/max` list if parsing fails).

Z.AI atoms are **not** all effort-less: **GLM-5.3** (`glm5_3`) has 3 real
wire states (`off`/`high`/`max`) settable via the long-form suffix
(`glm5_3-max`) or raw `zai/glm-5.3@max` — one more
than every *other* Z.AI/GLM atom (5-turbo, 4.7, 4.6, ...), which
exposes only a boolean thinking toggle (`off`/`on`). Both forms are
validated against the atom's real levels; `crush models efforts <model>`
prints the exact list and commands for any specific model. (GLM-5.3's
context window/levels are provisional — see the comment above its entry
in `internal/cmd/models_atoms.go`.) The web UI's model picker also shows
GLM-5.3: since docs.z.ai and the upstream catwalk provider registry don't
list it yet, `internal/config/load.go`'s `configureProviders` synthesizes
the same provisional entry into the Z.AI provider's model list (skipped
once catwalk or your own `providers.zai.models` config actually provides
one), so both the CLI atom and the web picker agree.

```bash
crush models use opus-high glm5_turbo                # mixed Anthropic large + Z.AI small
crush models use --local glm5_3 glm5_turbo           # workspace-only override
crush models use openai/gpt-5@high zai/glm-5-turbo   # raw provider/model fallback for anything not in the atom list

# Also set worker/reviewer in the same call (independent of large/small)
crush models use opus-high haiku-low --worker glm5_turbo --reviewer opus-max

# Change ONE slot only, leaving the other three exactly as they are —
# --large/--small work just like --worker/--reviewer always have. The two
# positional args and --large/--small are mutually exclusive per call.
crush models use --small glm4_7_flash
crush models use --large opus-high

# Discover effort levels for a specific model (or run with no arg for the
# full per-provider overview, including the Z.AI graduated-vs-boolean split)
crush models efforts glm5_3

# Step a role's effort by one level instead of retyping the full atom name
crush models bump reviewer up
crush models bump worker down --local
```

`models state` shows the currently-effective values for all four slots and
the per-scope breakdown so you always know whether your `--local` workspace
overrides your global default or vice versa.

**The cascade has a third level: session.** `--global`/`--local` (system/
workspace) both live in a `crush.json` file and are what `models state`
reports. On top of that, the **web UI** lets each open session pin its own
large/small/worker/reviewer, stored in that session's DB row, not in any
`crush.json` — so it's invisible to `models state` and to other sessions.
Resolution order is always **system → folder → session**: a session with no
override inherits whatever `models state` would show; setting one there
wins for that session only, and clearing it (the model picker's "Inherit"
entry, or the "Default models" modal's per-slot clear button) falls straight
back to the folder/system value. The web UI's header **"Default models"**
button opens a modal with three blocks — System, Folder, Session — each
showing all four slots: what's explicitly set at that level, or, when
unset, the inherited value and which level it's coming from.

> **Removed in batch 11:** `crush models set --large X --small Y` and the
> entire `crush models preset` subtree (save/use/list/delete). Both
> commands now print a redirect notice pointing at `crush models use`.

To clear an override and fall back to the other scope: `crush models unset
[large|small|worker|reviewer|both|all] [--local|--global]`. `both` (the
default when the arg is omitted) clears large+small only; `all` clears all
four slots. Missing keys are a no-op.

## When NOT to use this fork

- **You want the TUI experience.** Use upstream — the fork removed it.
- **You want a stable, blessed-by-Charm distribution path.** This fork
  does not publish Homebrew/winget/AUR releases.
- **You want the official REST `/v1/...` protocol for wrapping.** This
  fork speaks WebSocket only.
- **You're a human typing into one terminal session at a time.**
  Upstream's TUI is genuinely nicer for that. This fork's CLI is shaped
  for scripts and orchestrators; the web UI is for peeking in, not for
  daily-driving conversational work.

## When this fork is exactly the right tool

- You're building a multi-agent system where one LLM delegates code
  work to another. `crush run` is that worker; the envelope is the
  protocol between them.
- You run a multi-section audit / refactor / migration as 5+ parallel
  `crush run` invocations against one repo and need the cost
  accounting + lock-file + atomic-write guarantees that follow.
- You wrap LLMs in CI: stable `--session` key per build matrix,
  `--timeout` for budget control, `--json` for jq-parseable output,
  `--format json` for raw JSON contracts with validation.
- You want a long-running embedded coding agent reachable over a
  browser-served WebSocket from a thin React UI.

The original upstream README follows below, kept verbatim because most
of its content (installation, configuration, MCP/LSP setup, model
providers) applies unchanged to this fork. Where the fork diverges,
either the text above or `CHANGELOG.fork.md` overrides.

# Crush (upstream)

> Logo, release badge, build-status badge and demo GIF removed — they
> point at upstream `charmbracelet/crush` artifacts (Charm's logo,

## Features

- **Multi-Model:** choose from a wide range of LLMs or add your own via OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible APIs
- **Flexible:** switch LLMs mid-session while preserving context
- **Session-Based:** maintain multiple work sessions and contexts per project
- **LSP-Enhanced:** Crush uses LSPs for additional context, just like you do
- **Extensible:** add capabilities via MCPs (`http`, `stdio`, and `sse`)
- **Works Everywhere:** first-class support in every terminal on macOS, Linux, Windows (PowerShell and WSL), Android, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD
- **Industrial Grade:** built on the Charm ecosystem, powering 25k+ applications, from leading open source projects to business-critical infrastructure

## Installation

This fork ships as an npm package:

```bash
npm install -g @phpcraftdream/crush
crush run --role smart "your prompt here"
```

Or build from source (requires Go 1.26+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PHPCraftdream/crush.git
cd crush
go build -o crush .
```

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to grab an API key for your preferred
provider such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, or Vercel AI Gateway and just start
Crush. You'll be prompted to enter your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers.

### Subscriptions

If you prefer subscription-based usage, here are some plans that work well in
Crush:

- [Synthetic](https://synthetic.new/pricing)
- [GLM Coding Plan](https://z.ai/subscribe)
- [Kimi Code](https://www.kimi.com/membership/pricing)
- [MiniMax Coding Plan](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/coding-plan)

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

(Upstream's Catwalk badge image removed — see the project at
[charmbracelet/catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk).)

## Configuration

> [!TIP]
> Crush ships with a builtin `crush-config` skill for configuring itself. In
> many cases you can simply ask Crush to configure itself.

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json`

Items 1 and 2 are searched by name in the project root, walking up the
directory tree from `cwd` — a file at `./.crush/crush.json` (inside the
`.crush/` subdirectory) is not discovered; that directory holds ephemeral
data, not config.

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "this-setting": { "this": "that" },
  "that-setting": ["ceci", "cela"]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application
state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```

> [!TIP]
> You can override the user and data config locations by setting:
>
> - `CRUSH_GLOBAL_CONFIG`
> - `CRUSH_GLOBAL_DATA`

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "lsp": {
    "go": {
      "command": "gopls",
      "env": {
        "GOTOOLCHAIN": "go1.24.5"
      }
    },
    "typescript": {
      "command": "typescript-language-server",
      "args": ["--stdio"]
    },
    "nix": {
      "command": "nil"
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three transport
types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints, and `sse`
for Server-Sent Events.

Shell-style value expansion (`$VAR`, `${VAR:-default}`, `$(command)`, quoting,
nesting) works in `command`, `args`, `env`, `headers`, and `url`, so
file-based secrets work out of the box. You can use values like `"$TOKEN"`
or `"$(cat /path/to/secret/token)"`. Expansion runs through Crush's embedded
shell, so the same syntax works on every supported system, Windows included.

Unset variables expand to the empty string by default, matching bash. For
required credentials, use `${VAR:?message}` so an unset variable fails loudly
at load time with `message` instead of silently resolving to empty:

```json
{ "api_key": "${CODEBERG_TOKEN:?set CODEBERG_TOKEN}" }
```

Headers (both MCP `headers` and provider `extra_headers`) whose value
resolves to the empty string are dropped from the outgoing request rather
than sent as `Header:`. That keeps optional env-gated headers like
`"OpenAI-Organization": "$OPENAI_ORG_ID"` clean when the variable is unset.

Provider `extra_body` is a non-expanding JSON passthrough; put env-driven
values in `extra_headers` or the provider's `api_key` / `base_url`, all of
which do expand.

> **Security note:** `crush.json` is trusted code. Any `$(...)` in it runs at
> load time with your shell's privileges, before the UI appears. Don't launch
> Crush in a directory whose `crush.json` you haven't reviewed.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "mcp": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server.js"],
      "timeout": 120,
      "disabled": false,
      "disabled_tools": ["some-tool-name"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "timeout": 120,
      "disabled": false,
      "disabled_tools": ["create_issue", "create_pull_request"],
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer $GH_PAT"
      }
    },
    "streaming-service": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp/sse",
      "timeout": 120,
      "disabled": false,
      "headers": {
        "API-Key": "$(echo $API_KEY)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Hooks

Crush has preliminary support for hooks. For details, see
[the hook guide](./docs/hooks/).

### Global context files

Crush automatically includes two files for cross-project instructions.

- `~/.config/crush/CRUSH.md`: Crush-specific rules that would confuse other
  agentic coding tools. If you only use Crush, this is the only one you need to
  edit.
- `~/.config/AGENTS.md`: generic instructions that other coding tools might
  read. Avoid referring to Crush-specific features or workflows here. You
  probably only care about this if you use multiple agentic coding tools and
  want to share instructions between them.

You can customize these paths using the `global_context_paths` option in your
configuration:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "global_context_paths": [
      "~/path/to/custom/context/file.md",
      "/full/path/to/folder/of/files/" // recursively load all .md files in folder
    ]
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don't want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you'd like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "permissions": {
    "allowed_tools": [
      "view",
      "ls",
      "grep",
      "edit",
      "mcp_context7_get-library-doc"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Restricting `crush run`

Non-interactive `crush run` invocations auto-approve every permission request
by default (no human is on the keyboard). The `permissions.run` block flips
that to deny-by-default so an unattended run can be scoped to a known-safe
allowlist. Interactive sessions (TUI / web) are never affected.

Set `permissions.run.restrict` to `true`, then list the non-bash tools
(`allow_tools`, same `tool` / `tool:action` syntax as `allowed_tools`) and
bash command patterns (`allow_bash`) the run may use. Anything outside those
lists is denied cleanly.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "permissions": {
    "run": {
      "restrict": true,
      "allow_tools": ["view", "edit:write"],
      "allow_bash": [
        "git diff",
        "glob:ls *",
        "regex:^go (test|build)"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`allow_bash` entries take one of four forms:

- `cmd args` — word-boundary prefix match (e.g. `"git diff"` matches
  `"git diff HEAD~1"` but not `"git difftool"`). Chaining metacharacters
  (`;`, `|`, `&&`, `$(`, `` ` ``) are refused, so `"ls"` can never approve
  `"ls && rm -rf /"`.
- `exact:cmd` — whole-string equality after trimming whitespace; same
  chaining guard.
- `glob:pat` — `filepath.Match` against the raw command string. No chaining
  guard (explicit user wildcard).
- `regex:pat` — regexp match against the raw command string. No chaining
  guard (explicit user pattern).

`allow_tools` entries for `"bash"` / `"bash:execute"` are intentionally
ignored by the run gate — bash is governed solely by `allow_bash`, so an
operator can't accidentally authorise arbitrary shell commands by listing
the tool name. To bypass the gate for bash wholesale, use the global
`permissions.allowed_tools` (which is checked before the gate); otherwise
leave `bash` out of `allowed_tools` and use `run.allow_bash`.

The same options are available as CLI flags on `crush run`, which merge
(union) with the config block. `--restrict-run` forces restrict on even
when the config has it off:

```sh
crush run --restrict-run \
  --allow-bash 'git diff' \
  --allow-bash 'glob:ls *' \
  --allow-tool view \
  --allow-tool edit:write \
  "fix the failing tests"
```

### Disabling Built-In Tools

If you'd like to prevent Crush from using certain built-in tools entirely, you
can disable them via the `options.disabled_tools` list. Disabled tools are
completely hidden from the agent.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "disabled_tools": ["bash", "sourcegraph"]
  }
}
```

To disable tools from MCP servers, see the [MCP config section](#mcps).

### Disabling Skills

If you'd like to prevent Crush from using certain skills entirely, you can
disable them via the `options.disabled_skills` list. Disabled skills are hidden
from the agent, including builtin skills and skills discovered from disk.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "disabled_skills": ["crush-config"]
  }
}
```

### Agent Skills

Crush supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard for
extending agent capabilities with reusable skill packages. Skills are folders
containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that Crush can discover and
activate on demand.

The global paths we looks for skills are:

* `$CRUSH_SKILLS_DIR`
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agents/skills` or `~/.config/agents/skills/`
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/crush/skills` or `~/.config/crush/skills/`
* `~/.agents/skills/`
* `~/.claude/skills/`
* On Windows, we _also_ look at
  * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agents\skills\` or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\agents\skills\`
  * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\skills\` or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\crush\skills\`
* Additional paths configured via `options.skills_paths`

On top of that, we _also_ load skills in your project from the following
relative paths:

* `.agents/skills`
* `.crush/skills`
* `.claude/skills`
* `.cursor/skills`

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "skills_paths": [
      "~/.config/crush/skills", // Windows: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\\crush\\skills",
      "./project-skills",
    ],
  },
}
```

You can get started with example skills from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills):

```bash
# Unix
mkdir -p ~/.config/crush/skills
cd ~/.config/crush/skills
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git _temp
mv _temp/skills/* . && rm -rf _temp
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
mkdir -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\crush\skills"
cd "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\crush\skills"
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git _temp
mv _temp/skills/* . ; rm -r -force _temp
```

#### User-Invocable Skills

Skills can be made invocable as commands from the commands palette (Ctrl+P). Add `user-invocable: true` to the skill's YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: A skill that can be invoked as a command.
user-invocable: true
---
```

User-invocable skills appear in the commands palette with a `user:` or `project:` prefix:
- Skills from global directories show as `user:skill-name`
- Skills from project directories show as `project:skill-name`

When invoked, the skill's instructions are loaded into the conversation context.

To prevent the model from auto-triggering a skill (while still allowing user invocation), add `disable-model-invocation: true`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Only invocable by users, not the model.
user-invocable: true
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

Skills with `disable-model-invocation` won't appear in the model's available skills list but can still be invoked manually by users.

### Desktop notifications

Crush sends desktop notifications when a tool call requires permission and when
the agent finishes its turn. They're only sent when the terminal window isn't
focused _and_ your terminal supports reporting the focus state.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "disable_notifications": false, // default
  },
}
```

To disable desktop notifications, set `disable_notifications` to `true` in your
configuration. On macOS, notifications currently lack icons due to platform
limitations.

### Initialization

When you initialize a project, Crush analyzes your codebase and creates
a context file that helps it work more effectively in future sessions.
By default, this file is named `AGENTS.md`, but you can customize the
name and location with the `initialize_as` option:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "initialize_as": "AGENTS.md"
  }
}
```

This is useful if you prefer a different naming convention or want to
place the file in a specific directory (e.g., `CRUSH.md` or
`docs/LLMs.md`). Crush will fill the file with project-specific context
like build commands, code patterns, and conventions it discovered during
initialization.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Crush adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with the `attribution` option:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "attribution": {
      "trailer_style": "co-authored-by",
      "generated_with": true
    }
  }
}
```

- `trailer_style`: Controls the attribution trailer added to commit messages
  (default: `assisted-by`)
  - `assisted-by`: Adds `Assisted-by: Crush:[ModelID]` as specified in [the convention](https://docs.kernel.org/process/coding-assistants.html#attribution)

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that we support two "types" for OpenAI. Make sure to choose the right one
> to ensure the best experience!
>
> - `openai` should be used when proxying or routing requests through OpenAI.
> - `openai-compat` should be used when using non-OpenAI providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don't forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "providers": {
    "deepseek": {
      "type": "openai-compat",
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "api_key": "$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "deepseek-chat",
          "name": "Deepseek V3",
          "cost_per_1m_in": 0.27,
          "cost_per_1m_out": 1.1,
          "cost_per_1m_in_cached": 0.07,
          "cost_per_1m_out_cached": 1.1,
          "context_window": 64000,
          "default_max_tokens": 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "providers": {
    "custom-anthropic": {
      "type": "anthropic",
      "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
      "api_key": "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
      "extra_headers": {
        "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01"
      },
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
          "cost_per_1m_in": 3,
          "cost_per_1m_out": 15,
          "cost_per_1m_in_cached": 3.75,
          "cost_per_1m_out_cached": 0.3,
          "context_window": 200000,
          "default_max_tokens": 50000,
          "can_reason": true,
          "supports_attachments": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Crush currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

- A Bedrock provider will appear once you have AWS configured, i.e. `aws configure`
- Crush also expects the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to be set
- To use a specific AWS profile set `AWS_PROFILE` in your environment, i.e. `AWS_PROFILE=myprofile crush`
- Alternatively to `aws configure`, you can also just set `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "providers": {
    "vertexai": {
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "claude-sonnet-4@20250514",
          "name": "VertexAI Sonnet 4",
          "cost_per_1m_in": 3,
          "cost_per_1m_out": 15,
          "cost_per_1m_in_cached": 3.75,
          "cost_per_1m_out_cached": 0.3,
          "context_window": 200000,
          "default_max_tokens": 50000,
          "can_reason": true,
          "supports_attachments": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Models

Local models can also be configured via OpenAI-compatible API. Here are two common examples:

#### Ollama

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "name": "Ollama",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1/",
      "type": "openai-compat",
      "models": [
        {
          "name": "Qwen 3 30B",
          "id": "qwen3:30b",
          "context_window": 256000,
          "default_max_tokens": 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### LM Studio

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "lmstudio": {
      "name": "LM Studio",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:1234/v1/",
      "type": "openai-compat",
      "models": [
        {
          "name": "Qwen 3 30B",
          "id": "qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507",
          "context_window": 256000,
          "default_max_tokens": 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "debug": true,
    "debug_lsp": true
  }
}
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Crush automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Crush provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Crush automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates, set `disable_provider_auto_update` into
your `crush.json` config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "disable_provider_auto_update": true
  }
}
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

## Provider management

Crush provides a suite of commands to inspect and manage LLM providers:

### List providers

```bash
# List all configured providers across global and workspace scopes
crush providers list

# Filter by id, name, or type (case-insensitive substring match)
crush providers list --grep zai

# Emit JSON for further processing
crush providers list --json | jq '.[] | select(.type=="openai")'
```

Output shows ID, name, type, status (enabled/disabled), model count, and (masked) API key.

### Show provider details

```bash
# Show full details for a provider
crush providers show openai

# Emit JSON
crush providers show openai --json
```

### Enable/disable a provider

```bash
# Enable a disabled provider (re-enables it and refreshes models)
crush providers enable zai

# Disable a provider (keeps credentials, sets disabled flag)
crush providers disable openai
```

### Add a new provider

```bash
# Add a catwalk-known provider (uses default base URL from catwalk)
crush providers add zai --name "Z.AI" --type openai-compat --api-key $ZAI_API_KEY

# Add with a custom base URL
crush providers add local-llm --name "Local LLM" --type openai-compat \
  --base-url http://localhost:8000/v1 --api-key none

# Add but don't enable
crush providers add myProvider --name "My Provider" --type openai \
  --api-key $KEY --no-enable
```

### Remove a provider

```bash
# Remove a provider with confirmation
crush providers remove openai

# Remove without prompting (required in non-interactive mode)
crush providers remove openai --yes
```

### Update provider models

```bash
# Refresh models for a single provider
crush providers update zai

# Refresh models for all enabled providers
crush providers update --all
```

Shows a diff of added/removed models. Warns if any currently-preferred model is orphaned.

### Filter providers (grep sugar)

```bash
# Equivalent to `providers list --grep pattern`
crush providers grep openai-compat
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `crush update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
crush update-providers

# Update providers from a custom Catwalk base URL.
crush update-providers https://example.com/

# Update providers from a local file.
crush update-providers /path/to/local-providers.json

# Reset providers to the embedded version, embedded at crush at build time.
crush update-providers embedded

# For more info:
crush update-providers --help
```

## Metrics

Crush records pseudonymous usage metrics (tied to a device-specific hash),
which maintainers rely on to inform development and support priorities. The
metrics include solely usage metadata; prompts and responses are NEVER
collected.

Details on exactly what’s collected are in the source code
([here](https://github.com/PHPCraftdream/crush/tree/main/internal/event)
and [here](https://github.com/PHPCraftdream/crush/blob/main/internal/config/config.go)).

You can opt out of metrics collection at any time by setting the environment
variable by setting the following in your environment:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_METRICS=1
```

Or by setting the following in your config:

```json
{
  "options": {
    "disable_metrics": true
  }
}
```

Crush also respects the [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://donottrack.sh/) convention
which can be enabled via `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

## Q&A

### Why is clipboard copy and paste not working?

Installing an extra tool might be needed on Unix-like environments.

| Environment         | Tool                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Windows             | Native support           |
| macOS               | Native support           |
| Linux/BSD + Wayland | `wl-copy` and `wl-paste` |
| Linux/BSD + X11     | `xclip` or `xsel`        |
