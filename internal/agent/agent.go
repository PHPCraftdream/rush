	// with its own stream watchdog, started strictly LATER than the
	// parent's (the parent starts timing from OnToolCall — the moment it
	// decided to delegate; the child starts timing only once its own turn
	// actually begins executing, after init and the DB preamble). Both
	// watchdogs share the same toolMaxDuration, so the parent's clock — with
	// its head start — would always reach the cap first and cancel genCtx,
	// which cascades into the child's ctx, before the child's own watchdog
	// ever gets a chance to fire on ITS cap and unwind cleanly (finish part,
	// cost transfer per task #197, goroutine dump). This grace is applied
	// uniformly to every tool-in-flight regardless of kind — it is not a
	// tool-name-keyed special case (that pattern was deliberately rejected
	// above); it just gives whichever tool is running a little extra runway
	// past its nominal cap, which is harmless for a plain tool and decisive
	// for a delegation. Configurable via Options.ToolCleanupGrace for tests;
	// 0 falls back to this default rather than disabling the grace, since an
	// accidental zero would silently reopen the race this constant exists
	// to close.
	//
	// HONEST SCOPE (found overstated by an @oh review of task #205's own
	// fix — corrected here rather than in a follow-up commit that could go
	// unread): 90s only guarantees the child wins the race against the
	// PARENT'S watchdog start skew — the gap between the parent's OnToolCall
	// and the child's own watchdog starting (init + DB preamble), which
	// really is sub-second to low seconds. It does NOT bound how long the
	// child may productively work before the tool call that actually wedges
	// starts. Concretely: parent fires at delegationStart + M + 90s; child
	// fires at (delegationStart + skew + workDuration) + M, where
	// workDuration is the child's own prior productive work before hitting
	// its stuck tool — unbounded, since the child's watchdog resets on every
	// tool-call boundary (see toolFinished's doc below). The child wins only
	// when skew + workDuration < 90s, i.e. only when the child wedges
	// EARLY (near-immediately after being delegated to) — the common "child
	// worked productively for minutes, THEN wedged deep into its turn" case
	// is NOT covered: the parent still force-cancels it first. What this
	// grace DOES guarantee unconditionally: the parent never fires before
	// its own toolMaxDuration+90s has elapsed since delegating, giving any
	// child that happens to wedge quickly (the case this was originally
	// observed in) real runway to clean up. A structural fix for the general
	// case would need the child to push progress signals the parent's own
	// watchdog resets on — not implemented; tracked as a follow-up, not a
	// release blocker, since the practical loss on the uncovered path is
	// diagnostic quality (finish part / goroutine dump), not correctness —
	// the parent still terminates, and task #197 already made the
	// cost-transfer step itself cancel-immune.
	//
	// Fork patch, task #205: this default is applied ONLY to a NON-sub-agent
	// (top-level) session — see effectiveToolCleanupGrace's doc. Applying it
	// to a sub-agent's own watchdog as well (task #200's original fix) made
	// the race worse, not better: with identical toolMaxDuration+grace on
	// both sides, the 90s cancels out of the "child must fire before parent"
	// inequality algebraically, leaving the parent's head start (from
	// OnToolCall, before the child's own watchdog even starts) as the only
	// deciding factor — so the parent always still won regardless of how
	// early the child wedged. A sub-agent can never itself be waiting on a
	// nested `agent`-tool delegation (the `agent` tool is excluded from
	// workerToolNames for sub-agents — see buildToolsAgentConfig), so it is

	// shuttingDown latches on the first CancelAll and is checked by Run
	// before it claims any session. Round 14 closing review, blocker 1:
	// the per-mailbox `stopped` latch only stops an EXISTING turn loop from
	// picking up more work — it cannot stop a NEW owner from appearing.
	// After CancelAll's sweep, a mailbox that ends at mbIdle happily grants
	// ownership to the next Run(), which then runs a full provider turn
	// that the (already-finished) sweep will never cancel. Worse, mailboxes
	// are created lazily, so a Run for a session id the sweep never saw
	// gets a fresh mailbox with stopped == false — no race required.
	//
	// Entry points that can still call Run after the sweep are real and
	// several: coordinator.startDetachedRun (its own detached goroutine on
	// a WithoutCancel context), runSummarize's tail, Summarize, and the web
	// handlers — none of which observe per-mailbox state.

	// admitMu/stopping form the admission gate that closes a real "Add
	// concurrently with Wait" race between Run()/Summarize's runWg.Add(1)
	// and CancelAll's runWg.Wait(). P1-1: Run/Summarize used to call
	// runWg.Add(1) and then check shuttingDown as two separate,
	// unsynchronized steps. Between the Add and the check, a concurrent
	// CancelAll could set shuttingDown and spin up its runWg.Wait() goroutine
	// while the counter was still 0 — Wait() could then return (nothing to
	// wait for) a moment before the Add(1) landed, which either panics
	// ("Add called concurrently with Wait", per the sync.WaitGroup contract:
	// "calls with a positive delta that start when the counter is zero
	// must happen before a Wait") or lets a new Run/Summarize start after
	// CancelAll has already told its caller shutdown was safe.
	//
	// The fix: shuttingDown is only ever flipped false->true, and every
	// read (Run/Summarize via tryAdmitRunWg) and the one write (CancelAll)
	// happen under admitMu. So either the Run/Summarize critical section
	// runs entirely before CancelAll's (shuttingDown was still false:
	// runWg.Add(1) is guaranteed to complete, and complete-before, CancelAll's
	// subsequent cancel+Wait-spawn), or it runs entirely after (shuttingDown
	// is already true: tryAdmitRunWg bails out and never calls Add at all).
	// There is no interleaving left where Add and Wait can race.
