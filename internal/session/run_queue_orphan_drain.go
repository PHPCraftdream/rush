	// finding M6): using context.Background() here detached this drain
	// entirely from p.ctx/Stop(), so a slow drain could keep running for
	// up to 10s past Stop() being called, well beyond Stop()'s own 5s
	// shutdown grace period -- which would then report a forced
	// (non-graceful) shutdown even though nothing was actually stuck, just
	// running on a clock nothing else knew about.
	//
	// Also NOT the caller's ctx parameter (drainOrphanOutbox's own 5s-
	// bound scan context, now unused here): chaining context.WithTimeout
	// off an already-5s-bound parent still caps the effective deadline at
	// 5s regardless of the timeout passed here (context.WithTimeout takes
	// the EARLIER of the two deadlines) -- that 5s budget is sized for the
	// list scan, not for this transaction, and cutting the transaction
	// short at that boundary would be worse than giving it a longer, but
	// still pump-shutdown-aware, budget. Deriving straight from p.ctx (not

	// cancelled promptly on Stop(), with a real 10s budget in the

	// No attempts-counter/terminal-failed state on this path (task #440
	// follow-up decision): an entry whose call_data is genuinely malformed
	// -- the ONLY way DrainOrphanOutboxEntry's inner INSERT can keep
	// failing forever, since the FK ON DELETE CASCADE on session_id
	// already removes any entry whose session no longer exists -- retries
	// on every drain tick indefinitely, logged at ERROR each time rather
	// than silently dropped or auto-escalated to a terminal state. This
	// was a deliberate choice to keep DrainOrphanOutboxEntry a single
	// atomic transaction (insert-to-main-queue + delete-from-outbox) with
	// no separate attempts-tracking write to race against; the older
	// claim/mark-failed model this superseded (task #426) is gone. See
