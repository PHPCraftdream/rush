// `rush sessions audit` — a strictly read-only scan of a session database
// for anomalies (a session repeating the same work, a delegation that never
// finished, a supervision loop).
//
// The command is the scaffold plus the rules: data-dir resolution, a mode=ro
// open, a schema check, DB health and a per-session summary live in
// sessions_audit_db.go, and the suspicion rules themselves in
// sessions_audit_findings.go (their thresholds are the const block below)
// with the readers they count with in sessions_audit_rules.go.
//
// This command deliberately does NOT go through setupApp: setupApp opens the
// database read-write and runs migrations, which is exactly what an audit
// must never do — it may be pointed at a live data directory whose real
// writer is mid-turn.

var sessionsAuditCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "audit [<id>|--all]",
	Short: "Scan session DB for anomalies (strictly read-only)",
	Long: `Audit a session database for anomalies: a session repeating the same
work, a delegation that never finished, a supervision loop.

Read-only: the database is opened with mode=ro and PRAGMA query_only; no
migrations, no locks, no writes — the rush.db file is not modified (not even
its mtime), and no -wal/-shm/journal sidecar is created or removed. This is
deliberately NOT the setupApp path, which opens the database read-write and
migrates it: audit resolves the data directory itself, the same lightweight
way "sessions reap" and "sessions kill" do.

A missing database, or one whose schema is not a Rush schema, is reported
and exits 0 — audit creates nothing, migrates nothing and fixes nothing.

Flags:
  --all          audit every session in the database
  --since <d>    only messages newer than a Go duration (30m, 24h), a day
                 suffix (7d), or a bare integer read as days
  --worktrees    also scan the databases of the linked worktrees: every
                 other checkout Rush has registered keeps its own
                 .rush/rush.db (see "rush projects", read-only)
  --json         one JSON object per scanned database instead of text
  --data-dir <p> (inherited from the root command) the data directory to
                 read; defaults to <cwd>/.rush

Selection: pass a full session id, or a prefix of one. A prefix matching
more than one session is refused — re-run with the full id.

Rules and thresholds:
  the same file viewed again and again                >= 3 times
  the same normalized bash command repeated           >= 3 times
  wait-only commands (sleep/poll loops)               >= 3 times
  tool errors, counted per error class                >= 3 times
  supervision / wake_failed notices                   >= 1
  unfinished async jobs (state running/interrupted)   >= 1
A session's verdict lists the rules it tripped, the evidence (file path,
command or notice) and the counts. Every rule is implemented and every
threshold is declared once as a constant, so the help and the analysis can
never drift apart. Wait-only means a command that does nothing but wait:
after every run of digits has been folded to "N", its whole line has to
match one of 'sleep 5', 'timeout 30 <cmd>', 'wait', 'job_output 12 --wait'
or a poll/wait helper. A command that waits and then works ('sleep 5 && git
status') is ordinary work, counted as a repeated command instead.

DB health is printed for every scanned database: size, page_size x
page_count, freelist pages and the percentage of the file that is free
space, plus the size of the rush.db-wal and rush.db-shm sidecars when the
database is live in WAL mode.`,
	Example: `
# Audit every session's last 24 hours of activity
rush sessions audit --all --since 24h

# Include the linked worktrees' databases, machine-readable
rush sessions audit --worktrees --json

# Point at a data directory other than <cwd>/.rush
rush sessions audit --data-dir /path/to/.rush --all

# A single session, by id or by prefix
