// PeakHoursGuidance returns the orchestrator-facing instruction paragraph
// for ANY peak-hours refusal — both the immediate "refused at the start of
// a new invocation" case (checkPeakHours' pre-flight call sites) and the
// "force-stopped an already-in-flight turn" case (the OnStepFinish
// mid-turn re-check). Both must carry the same guidance: this is not a
// crash, crush will not retry on its own, and an orchestrating agent
// should schedule a resume for the exact reopen time rather than retry
// immediately.
//
// This is the single source of truth for the guidance text — both app.go
// (stderr output before fang's ERROR box) and peakHoursStoppedFinishText
// (DB finish-message details) call it, so the operator-visible stderr
// text and the recorded DB details stay identical.
//
// err is whatever checkPeakHours returned. When it is (or wraps) a
// *PeakHoursError we pull the exact ReopensAt time.Time out of it — via
// errors.As, not string parsing — so the instruction gives an
// orchestrating agent an unambiguous, cron-ready timestamp instead of
// making it parse "refusing until 12:00" out of prose. Falls back to a
// generic RESUME AT line if the type assertion fails (defensive: keeps
// working even if the error ever gets wrapped differently upstream).
