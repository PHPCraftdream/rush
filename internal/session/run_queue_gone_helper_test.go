package session_test

// Shared wait-helper for the durable run queue's pending-wait audit
// (branch fix/pending-wait-audit).
//
// ListPendingRunQueueEntries only scans status='pending'. A row the pump has
// leased and is executing RIGHT NOW — status='leased' — is invisible to it,
// so a wait of the form "poll until pending is empty" returns in two
// indistinguishable situations: (a) the row is terminally gone (Acked /
// terminal-failed), or (b) the run is merely in flight. Anything asserted
// right after such a wait (call counters, concurrency flags, message
// history) is therefore unordered relative to the run's remaining work.
//
// runQueueGoneEverywhere is the status-agnostic replacement: the row counts
// as "not done" while it is pending OR leased. AckRunQueueEntry and
// TerminalFailRunQueueEntry are only ever called AFTER the coordinator's Run
// has returned (run_queue_pump.go executeEntrySync's outcome branches), so
// "gone from both states" is the earliest observation point that is ordered
// after every write the run makes. This mirrors entryQueuedAnywhere in
// internal/agent/p482_run_queue_terminal_probe_test.go (commit c4c2f17c),
// which fixed the same defect for TestReleaseGate_9_DoubleFailureNoDuplicate;
// it lives here because the session package's tests cannot reach the agent
// package's helper.
