// Package pubsub provides a lightweight in-process broker for fan-out
// event delivery between services and the UI.
//
// Delivery semantics:
//
//   - [Broker.Publish] is best-effort and lossy under contention. If a
//     subscriber's channel is full, the event is dropped for that
//     subscriber, a warning is logged, and a counter is incremented.
//     This is the right choice for high-frequency intermediate updates
//     (e.g. streaming token deltas) where only the latest state
//     matters.
//
//   - [Broker.PublishMustDeliver] is bounded-blocking. For each
//     subscriber it first tries a non-blocking send, then falls back to
//     a per-subscriber blocking send with a hard timeout. On timeout the
//     event is dropped for that subscriber, an error is logged, and the
//     must-deliver drop counter is incremented. The publisher never
//     blocks indefinitely. This is the right choice for terminal events
//     (finish, tool result, error, cancel) that must not be silently
//     coalesced away.
//
// Drop counters ([Broker.DropCount], [Broker.MustDeliverDropCount]) are
// exposed so callers can surface saturation in telemetry.

// Use this for terminal events that must reach subscribers (finish,
// tool result, error, cancel). Callers must still tolerate rare drops
// after timeout — recovery is the subscriber's responsibility (e.g. a
// re-fetch on the next session-visible event).
//
// Delivery to subscribers is sequential, not parallel: each subscriber
// is handed the event (with its own bounded wait) before the next is
// considered, so worst-case wall-clock cost is O(N × timeout) for N
// slow subscribers. This is deliberate. The message broker has exactly
// one subscriber in practice — the web server's single fan-out
// goroutine (internal/server/events.go), which itself broadcasts to all
// WebSocket clients — or, in the non-interactive rush run path, one
// CLI output subscriber (internal/app/app.go). The broker never sees
// per-client subscriptions; client fan-out happens downstream of a
// single broker subscriber. With N effectively 1 (at most 2 if both
// paths ran at once), sequential delivery caps at ~1×timeout and avoids
// the goroutine-spawn and sync.WaitGroup overhead a parallel fan-out
// would impose on every terminal publish. If a second high-volume
// subscriber is ever added, revisit this: switch to a bounded parallel
// fan-out so the timeout stays O(timeout) instead of scaling with
// subscriber count.
