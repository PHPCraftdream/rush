// agent holding mb as sessionID's mailbox.

// The first draft of these tests re-implemented drain-and-dedup locally and
// asserted against the copy. That mirror passes whether or not production
// still agrees with it, which is precisely the defect task #243 was filed
// for ("new tests don't exercise agent.go's actual closure"). Production was
// therefore extracted into drainDueInjects so this helper can be a thin
// adapter instead of a second implementation.

// be spliced a second time on top of the history copy — the message appears
// twice in the turn's prepared.Messages.

// splice-vs-skip: here the next turn's preamble did NOT load it from DB
// (DB write was after the preamble), so it is spliced — delivered exactly
// once.

// IsSessionBusy could observe mbOwned, then the owner could release to mbIdle,
// and the append would strand the message in the queue of a session that was
// already idle — with the row also in the DB, the next Run would duplicate it.
