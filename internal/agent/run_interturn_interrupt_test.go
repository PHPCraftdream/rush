// TestRun_InterruptDuringInterTurnWindow_ReplacementRunsExactlyOnce is the
// end-to-end regression test for #307 (P1-2 follow-up): the window BETWEEN
// two turns, after Run's loop has cancelled the just-finished turn's
// turnCancel but strictly before it calls beginGeneration for the next one.
//
// Mechanism (see mailbox.interruptAndReplace's and reclaimReplacementOrKeep's
// own docs for the full account): drainOrReleaseFinal's every "keep
// ownership" branch (submitted/replacement/legacy-reclaim) leaves
// mb.current.cancel == nil — that is the exact postcondition
// mailbox_invariant_test.go's table checks. The loop only repopulates it via
// beginGeneration at the TOP of its next iteration. An InterruptAndReplace
// landing in that gap used to fall back to mb.dispatcherCancel, which is
// runCancel — the parent of every future turnCtx, never meant to be an
// interrupt target. Firing it there cancelled the whole dispatcher: the next
// turnCtx was born already-cancelled, its preamble failed immediately with
// context.Canceled, #284's preamble-recovery drained the mailbox once more
// (finding nothing, since the fix's own replacement had already been
// consumed or the recovery ran on a dead runCtx with nothing left to run it
// on), and Run returned an error — the replacement accepted, reported
// "queued", never actually executed.
//
// This test drives that exact interleaving deterministically using
// testLoopRearmSeam (#289's fix for exactly this kind of race — see that
// seam's own doc in mailbox.go) instead of a sleep-based race:
//
//  1. Turn 1 runs "first message" and blocks mid-stream.
//  2. While turn 1 is blocked, a STALE call is queued into the legacy
//     messageQueue — this is what drainOrReleaseMerged will decide to run
//     as turn 2 once turn 1 finishes (mb.submitted/mb.replacement are both
//     empty at that point, so it falls through to the legacy reclaim).
//  3. Turn 1 is allowed to finish. Its own end-of-turn drain reclaims the
//     stale call and returns hasNext=true; the loop goes to its next
//     iteration with call == the STALE call.
//  4. testLoopRearmSeam fires for the SECOND time (the first firing is turn
//     1's own loop entry, long before any of this) — by construction this
//     is strictly after the reclaim's critical section has already run
//     (mb.current.cancel nil, dispatcherCancel == runCancel) and strictly
//     before this same iteration's beginGeneration call. The loop parks
//     here.
//  5. While parked, the test calls sa.InterruptAndReplace with a REPLACEMENT
//     call and waits for it to return (hadOwner must be true).
//  6. The loop is released. It must run the REPLACEMENT, not the stale
//     call, as turn 2 — and that turn must actually reach the provider.
//
// Before the fix: step 5's InterruptAndReplace fired dispatcherCancel
// (runCancel), so step 6 aborted before the provider was ever reached again;
// Run returned a context.Canceled error and the replacement was never run at
// all — same shape as P0-A/P0-B, just via a different window.
//
// Closing-review update: an earlier draft of reclaimReplacementOrKeep
// discarded the pre-empted stale call instead of requeuing it (the #283/
// P0-2 class of bug — "interrupt deletes the very message it's supposed to
// queue behind"). This test's final assertions reflect the CORRECTED
// contract: the stale message is not lost, it is requeued and runs as turn
// 3 after the replacement. TestRun_InterruptDuringInterTurnWindow_MultiElementQueue_NoMessageLost
// below is the more direct regression test for that specific defect (it
// exercises the A/B/C-already-queued scenario the discard bug actually
// depended on to be observable); this test still stands on its own as the
// single-stale-message, real-Run()-level proof that the replacement itself
// pre-empts and reaches the provider.

//
// This is not assumed to be "the same bug, don't need a separate test" —
// verified directly, because the two windows differ in one way that could
// plausibly have mattered: mb.state transitions to mbOwned INSIDE submit()
// (mailbox.go), called from tryReserveSession, BEFORE Run() ever reaches its
// turn loop — as opposed to the inter-turn window, where state was already
// mbOwned from a PRIOR iteration and merely stays mbOwned across the gap.
// Tracing agent.go confirms nothing sits between submit() returning
// (mb.state already mbOwned, mb.current.cancel still its zero value nil)
// and the loop's first testLoopRearmSeam call except OS-lock acquisition
// (session.TryAcquireSessionLock), which never touches the mailbox — so the
// FIRST firing of testLoopRearmSeam is, in every mailbox-observable respect,
// the exact same shape as the SECOND-or-later firings this file's other
// tests exercise: state mbOwned, current.cancel nil, dispatcherCancel ==
// runCancel. This test drives that first firing directly instead of relying
// on that trace alone.
//
// This test's FIRST draft assumed "there is no stale call here: nothing can
// be queued in mb.submitted before the session's very first owner exists" —
// that assumption was checked, not trusted, by running the test, and it was
// WRONG: reclaimReplacementOrKeep's requeue fix (the closing-review fix for
// the #283/P0-2-class discard defect) treats the loop's own `call` local —
// turn 1's original, about-to-run prompt — exactly the same way it treats
// an inter-turn `call` popped from mb.submitted: it gets pushed onto
// mb.submitted and requeued behind the replacement, then runs as turn 2.
// There is nothing special about "the original prompt was never queued
// anywhere" that exempts it — reclaimReplacementOrKeep doesn't know or care
// where `call` came from. This is CORRECT behavior, consistent with the
// inter-turn window and with the same "nothing the caller submitted is
// silently lost" contract driving the whole closing-review fix — the
// assertions below reflect it: two provider calls (replacement, then the
// original prompt), not one.
