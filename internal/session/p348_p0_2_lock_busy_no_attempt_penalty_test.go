// P0-2 regression test (found in the final @oh review of tasks #337-349,
// 2026-08-10): run_queue_pump.go's processEntry terminal-failed (deleted)
// any entry that exhausted RunQueueMaxAttempts, including entries that
// only ever failed with SessionLockBusyError — ordinary, expected
// contention from another live process legitimately holding the OS
// session lock for the length of a normal turn. Worse, LeaseRunQueueEntryByID
// AND NackRunQueueEntry both incremented `attempts` per cycle, so
// RunQueueMaxAttempts=10 exhausted after only 5 real retry cycles (~15s at
// the production 3s tick) — a completely ordinary amount of lock
// contention. The result: accepted user work (a queued message, a
// cross-process interrupt, a retried orphaned call) could be silently
// deleted from the durable queue with no error surfaced to the user,
// defeating the entire point of task #340's durable-queue design.
//
// Fixed two ways:
//  1. LeaseRunQueueEntryByID no longer increments attempts (only
//     NackRunQueueEntry does, exactly once per completed failed attempt).
//  2. SessionLockBusyError specifically is nacked via
//     NackRunQueueEntryNoAttemptPenalty, which does not increment attempts
//     at all — lock contention can retry indefinitely without ever
//     exhausting RunQueueMaxAttempts.

// TestReleaseGate_P0_2_LockBusyNeverExhaustsRetries proves that an entry
// blocked purely by SessionLockBusyError survives far more than
// RunQueueMaxAttempts pump ticks without being terminal-failed (deleted),
// and is executed successfully once the contention clears.
//
// NO EXTERNAL POKE: the test never calls TerminalFailRunQueueEntry,
// NackRunQueueEntry, or processEntry directly — it only starts a real
// RunQueuePump (TestTick for speed) and asserts on the durable queue's
// observable state as the mock coordinator's own internal call counter
// advances.
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE:
//  1. In run_queue_pump.go's executeEntry, remove the `errors.As(err,
//     &busyErr)` branch (or make it fall through to the generic Nack path
//     that increments attempts).
//  2. Run: go test -run TestReleaseGate_P0_2_LockBusyNeverExhaustsRetries -v
//  3. FAIL: the entry is deleted (terminal-failed) after RunQueueMaxAttempts
//     cycles, well before busyUntilCall is reached — require.Eventually
//     for "eventually succeeds" times out because the entry no longer
//     exists to retry.
//  4. Restore the busy-error branch and PASS.
