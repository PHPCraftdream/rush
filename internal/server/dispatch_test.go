// raw bytes of the LAST overload reply in that streak.
//
// Why a streak, not just the first overload: under heavy -race scheduling
// (many parallel tests contending for OS threads), a single early overload
// reply can be a false signal that the pool/queue aren't actually
// warmed up yet — even after warmUpWorkerPool's two-wave barrier, a probe
// dispatch sent immediately after finding "the" overload has repeatedly
// been observed (in this file's own iteration history — see the #612
// test-fix notes) to be admitted into a queue that still had free slots,
// proving the earlier overload was transient, not steady-state saturation.
// Requiring several overloads in an unbroken row is a much stronger signal:
// once genuinely saturated (workerPoolSize running on <-release forever +
// workQueueDepth queued), EVERY subsequent dispatch must overload, forever,
// until release closes — so a streak can only end by transitioning to
// "still not saturated, one more got admitted", never by chance.
// dispatchBounded calls c.dispatch and fails the test if it does not return
// promptly, instead of letting a blocking admission hang the whole package.
//
// This exists because of how a regression here actually presents. Reverting
// dispatch's select/default back to a plain blocking send makes the very
// first filler that fills the queue block THIS goroutine forever, inside
// saturateUntilSteadyOverload's loop -- before the caller ever reaches its
// own bounded probe further down. Measured: `go test ./internal/server/`
// then ran until the 10-minute package timeout and reported
// `panic: test timed out after 10m0s` with the goroutine parked in
// (*Client).dispatch on a chan send. In CI that is a stuck job for the full
// timeout, not a red test -- the same failure shape that cost this project
// ten minutes per run when an unrelated pair of fixes interacted earlier in
// this series. A regression should say what broke, immediately.
//
// The goroutine is deliberately not waited on when it does block: it stays
// parked on the channel send until release closes, which is fine in an
// already-failing test and is the only way to report the hang at all.
