-- pending_injects is a cross-process signal/queue table for
-- `rush sessions inject`: one process (the CLI) writes a row here to ask
-- another already-running `rush run` process to splice a message into the
-- session it is actively executing. The message row itself is created in
-- `messages` at inject time (for immediate web-UI visibility, mirroring
-- handleInjectMessage); this table only references it by message_id so the
-- source of truth for what to merge is the messages table. content is kept
-- for debugging/logging only.
--
-- interrupt = 0 rows are drained + merged on the next PrepareStep by the
-- running agent (delete-after-read). interrupt = 1 rows are owned by the
-- interrupt ticker (a separate feature) which must consume them before the
-- next PrepareStep; PrepareStep only reports their presence, it does not
-- delete them.
