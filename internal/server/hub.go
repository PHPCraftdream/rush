//     spawning unbounded goroutines.
//   - Panic isolation: recovers any panic inside fn, logs it (with a stack
//     trace) instead of propagating it. Without this, a nil-deref or
//     out-of-range index triggered by an unexpected payload in ANY handler
//     would crash the entire crush web process, taking down every other

// goroutine gated by controlSem (a separate, generously-sized semaphore)
// instead of sem, and provides the SAME panic-recovery safety net as
// dispatch.
//
// Why this needs to exist at all: handleIncoming (handlers.go) calls dispatch
// synchronously from readPump's read loop (server.go) — the acquire
// `c.sem <- struct{}{}` blocks the CALLER once maxConcurrentHandlersPerConn
// long-running handlers (e.g. handleSendMessage, which can hold its slot for
// an entire multi-minute agent turn) are already in flight. If a
// cancel/interrupt command shared that same semaphore, it would queue behind
// those 12 slots — exactly when the user most needs it to go through
// immediately, e.g. to cancel one of the stuck turns. While readPump is
// blocked acquiring a slot, it never calls conn.ReadMessage() again, so the
// pong handler (registered in server.go) never runs to extend the read
// deadline, and the connection is torn down by an i/o timeout ~60s later
// (pongWait) — during which the user had no way to cancel anything on this
// connection.
//
// Using a separate, much larger semaphore instead of no gate at all keeps a
