// Fork-only file (concurrency / orchestrator UX): the --format and
// --agents flags exposed on `rush run` are inert to upstream and live
// here so a merge from origin/main never touches run.go's flag block.
// See CHANGELOG.fork.md (Section 4.J).

// formatPresetJSON is the canonical instruction appended to the user
// prompt when --format json is passed. The post-processor in app.go
// (stripAndValidateJSON) is the safety net when the model ignores it
// anyway. Wording tightened 2026-05-17 after the audit feedback
// showed glm-5.1 reliably writing a prose preamble despite the
// previous hint — the new version uses imperative voice, explains
// the machine-parsing consequence, and ends with a hard last-line
// instruction (most models attend to the LAST instruction more
// strongly than the first).
const formatPresetJSON = `## Output Format (mandatory, machine-parsed)

Your reply is parsed by ` + "`jq`" + ` on the final_text field. Any character
before the first ` + "`{`" + ` or ` + "`[`" + `, and any character after the matching
closing ` + "`}`" + ` or ` + "`]`" + `, causes a parse failure that aborts the wrapper
script. There is no human reading this turn's reply directly.

Rules:

1. Emit exactly one JSON value (object or array). Nothing else.
2. The very first character of your reply MUST be ` + "`{`" + ` or ` + "`[`" + `.
3. The very last character of your reply MUST be the matching ` + "`}`" + ` or ` + "`]`" + `.
4. Validate brackets balance and every ` + "`,`" + ` is followed by a key or value
   (no trailing commas, no missing ` + "`]`" + ` before another key).
5. No markdown code fence. No ` + "```json`" + `, no ` + "`````" + ` anywhere.
6. No prose preamble ("Here is...", "Let me compose...", "Now I'll output...").
7. No suffix ("Let me know if...", "Hope this helps.").
8. No explanations, sign-offs, or emojis outside of JSON string values.

Last line, repeated for attention: your reply starts with ` + "`{`" + ` or ` + "`[`" + ` and
ends with the matching ` + "`}`" + ` or ` + "`]`" + `. The wrapper does NOT strip prose for
you — invalid JSON fails the run.`

// resolveFormatHint turns the raw --format flag value into the text that
// will be appended to the user prompt. Returns ("", nil) when the flag
// was not passed.

// Supported forms:
//   - ""              → no hint (flag absent)
//   - "json"          → expand to formatPresetJSON
//   - "json-schema:<path>"
//     → read <path> as a JSON schema, build the prompt around it
//   - "@<path>"       → read <path> verbatim and use as the hint body
//     (lets the user keep multi-paragraph format specs in a file)
//   - any other text  → use as a freeform "Output format: <text>" hint

// agentsModePromptHint returns the user-prompt fragment associated with
// --agents=with-agents (nudging the model to fan out via the `agent`
// tool). The "single" mode is implemented by config mutation, not by a
// prompt, and "agent-allow" is the upstream default with no hint.
const agentsModePromptHint = `## Sub-agents

You have access to the ` + "`agent`" + ` tool. Use it to parallelise independent searches/lookups across multiple files or topics. The orchestrator explicitly requested fan-out for this run — prefer one ` + "`agent`" + ` dispatch per independent sub-task over doing them sequentially in your own turn.`

// aggregationConcatPromptHint is appended to the user prompt when
// --aggregation=concat is on. The motivation, from the 2026-05-17
// session #3 audit feedback: when the model dispatches multiple
// sub-agents via the ` + "`agent`" + ` tool, it often summarises their
// outputs into a one-paragraph wrap-up instead of preserving the
// detail (a 7× reduction was observed). With concat the orchestrator
// is asking the parent to include each sub-agent's reply verbatim in
// final_text. Compliance is best-effort (LLM hint), not guaranteed —
// pair with --aggregation=attach if you need the structured set.
const aggregationConcatPromptHint = `## Sub-agent Aggregation (mandatory)

If you dispatch sub-agents via the ` + "`agent`" + ` tool during this turn, your final answer MUST include each sub-agent's full reply verbatim, in dispatch order, separated by a clearly labelled heading. Do NOT summarise, paraphrase, condense, or "extract the key points". The orchestrator on top is parsing your final_text to recover sub-agent detail and any summarisation loses information it cannot get back.

Recommended layout:

` + "```" + `
## Sub-agent 1: <topic>
<verbatim sub-agent reply>

## Sub-agent 2: <topic>
<verbatim sub-agent reply>
` + "```" + `

A short top-level wrap-up paragraph BEFORE the sub-agent sections is fine; a wrap-up AFTER is also fine. The sub-agent verbatim sections must appear.`

// aggregationAttachPromptHint is the counterpart for --aggregation=attach.
// Here the orchestrator gets sub-agent outputs structured in
// envelope.sub_agent_outputs, so the parent's final_text is the place
// for a short wrap-up only. We don't want the model to also reproduce
// the sub-agent text inline — that would double the payload.
const aggregationAttachPromptHint = `## Sub-agent Aggregation

If you dispatch sub-agents via the ` + "`agent`" + ` tool during this turn, the orchestrator will receive each sub-agent's full reply separately in the envelope's ` + "`sub_agent_outputs`" + ` field. Your ` + "`final_text`" + ` should therefore be a brief wrap-up only: the synthesis, the conclusions, the cross-cutting observations — NOT a verbatim copy of the sub-agent outputs. Repeat detail only when it is essential for the wrap-up to make sense.`

// composeUserPrompt joins the user's prompt with optional format,
// agents and aggregation hints. The hints are appended (not prepended)
// so the user's original request stays at the top of the model's
// context, which most providers' attention curves still favour. Empty
// hints contribute nothing — no separator, no whitespace. Order:
// format → agents → aggregation; chosen so that "output shape" comes
// before "sub-agent policy" comes before "what to do with sub-agent
// output", which matches reasoning order.

	parts := []string{strings.TrimRight(prompt, "\n")}
