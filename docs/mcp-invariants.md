# MCP Invariant Registry

Task #902, stage 1.1 of `docs/plans/2026-09-09-mcp-consolidation-plan.md`.

Each row records one law the MCP lifecycle guard code protects — stated so it
survives a total rewrite of the mechanism, not the mechanism itself. Format:
`INV-NN | the law | where in code | proving test | commit that learned it`.

**Line numbers are as of worktree HEAD `2cf5f8379` (branch
`p902-invariant-registry`, 2026-09-09).** They will drift; re-anchor before
relying on them. Test columns name test functions in
`internal/agent/tools/mcp/*_test.go`. Commit columns are short hashes;
see the "Commit → invariant" section below for what each commit taught.

Where a review document disagreed with the code as read at this HEAD, the row
says so. Verified staleness of the 2026-09-07 chunk-5 review: CH5-1, CH5-2 and
CH5-3 are all closed on this HEAD (by `00c9911f5`, `70c98f828`, `00c9911f5`
respectively); the rows below reflect the closed state.

## Invariants

| ID | The law | Where (init.go unless noted) | Proven by | Learned in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INV-01 | A published session's transport outlives every context involved in creating it — admission, caller, and the initialization timeout; their cancellation may abort only an unpublished candidate, never a published session. | `sessionContext` handoff 5688-5840 (promote linearization 5768-5797), `createSessionWithAdmission` 5846-5877 + 5921 (timer disarmed on connect), 5942-5943; promote call sites 2327, 3207, 3841, 4264 | TestInitializePublishesHTTPSessionBeyondAdmission, TestPublishedSessionIgnoresCandidateCancellationUntilClose, TestSessionContextPromotionLinearizesCancellation, TestCommitRenewalPublishesOnlyAfterPromotion, TestOwnerCloseVsRenewalDoesNotPublishLateSession (init_test.go), TestSessionCancellationClassification (state_regression_test.go) | Broken by `01e909d0` (CR-1); law learned closing it: `5c8641e7`, `b7d8614f`; timeout leg `99371d14`; renewal leg `922316af` (CR-2) |
| INV-02 | All process-wide MCP state belongs to exactly one active Owner bound to exactly one ConfigStore, and the legacy implicit owner is replaced only after its registry is provably empty of work that could outlive the reset. | `acquire` 1680-1730, `canReclaimLocked` 1662-1678, `isCurrentLocked` 1947-1949, `rememberConfig` 2206-2219, store check 1383-1391; `IsConfigured` (init.go:2604-2610) | TestOwnerRejectsConfigStoreSwitch (uncertainty_fence_test.go), TestEnableServerFromOldOwnerCannotPublishIntoNewOwner, TestAcquireReclaimsEmptyImplicitOwnerWorkers, TestConcurrentAcquireReclaimsImplicitOwnerOnce | `5f2dbebc` (owner per application), `28ad297f` (idle-worker reclaim), `07a69d8f` (cross-store filtering) |
| INV-03 | Work authorized by an admission dies the moment its owner, owner generation, or the server's epoch changes — and an epoch is bumped only after the mutation's durable write is known to have succeeded, so a failed mutation never invalidates a healthy published session. | `serverAdmission` 1112-1143, `validLocked` 1304-1312, `committedValidLocked` 1327-1360, bump 1392-1398 and `invalidateServerLocked` 1617-1625, `cancelServerCandidates` (no bump) 1630-1640 | TestFailedDisableDoesNotCancelStartupCandidate, TestFailedRemoveDoesNotCancelStartupCandidate, TestReplaceKnownCommitFencesRuntimeAfterEpochInvalidation, TestRetiredClientCannotPublishAfterReplacement, TestDisableServerCancelsBlockedInitAndLeavesNoLateSession, TestRemoveServerCancelsBlockedInitAndRejectsLateCommit | `963d584a` (admission model); defect from `cf12608e` fixed by `71df8f19` (failed replace keeps old admission) |
| INV-04 | Owner shutdown joins every admitted initialization, refresh worker, and session close before resetting the process-wide registry — and an expired Close deadline leaves the owner fenced in closing state rather than letting old-owner callbacks touch the next owner's registry. | `finishClose` 2430-2492 (joins 2436-2439, cancel-before-close 2469-2474, reset 2480-2491), `Close` contract 2409-2428, `trackSessionLocked` 830-853 | TestOwnerCloseDeadlineRetainsFenceUntilStuckSessionCloses, TestOwnerCloseKeepsFenceWhileDetachedCloseBlocks, TestOwnerCloseResetsRegistryAndAllowsNextLifecycle, TestOwnerCloseJoinsCanceledRuntimeMCPResolution, TestOwnerCloseCancelsBlockedStartupBeforeCleanup, TestTrackRejectsAdoptionAfterCloseBegins | `5c8641e7` (tracked lifecycle joins), `01e909d0` (deadline keeps fence, R17-3), `60c81f78` (cancel-then-sequential-close) |
| INV-05 | Every mutation of `Owner.committedAdmissions` happens under `lifecycleMu` — a per-server lease is not sufficient, because disable/remove of server A and publish/renew of server B touch the same plain Go map on different names. | `detachSessionLocked` 4689-4693 (lock taken inside), `detachSessionLifecycleLocked` 4697-4707; writes 2346, 3235, 3944/3960/3967; reader 6057 | TestCommittedAdmissionsDisableAndPublishCrossServer, TestCommittedAdmissionsDifferentNameDetachIsSynchronized, TestCommittedAdmissionsDetachStructuralOracle (committed_admissions_sync_test.go) | Introduced unsynchronized by `f2914d53c` (CH5-1, P0); law learned by `00c9911f5`; cross-server oracle `0175b1e0` (stage 0.2) |
| INV-06 | Lock discipline: a server lease is taken before `lifecycleMu` and never the reverse; no network or disk I/O runs while holding `lifecycleMu` or a server lease; context cancellation happens outside lifecycle locks. | order comments 4687-4688, 6077-6079; no-I/O 610-611, 3863-3867, 1978-1983, 2093-2095; cancel-outside 219-224 | TestMutationPublicationTakesServerLeaseBeforeConfigLocks, TestDisableReleasesServerLeaseBeforeClosingDetachedTransport, TestSkippedTransitionReleasesLeaseBeforeBlockingRetirement, TestFailClosedMCPHonorsCallerCancellation, TestMCPAdmissionFinalTurnCancellationReleasesConfigLocks, TestReplacePersistRunsOutsideLifecycleLock, TestUncertaintyReloadRunsOutsideLifecycleLocks (no-I/O clause: lock-state probes at the replace-persist and uncertainty-reload seams, lock_discipline_test.go; scope limits in "NO-TEST findings") | `00c9911f5` (fixed detach order), `a470adf6` (moved transport closes outside the lease), `3e7f9df2`/era reviews (order verified) |
| INV-07 | Each server name has one lease instance that serializes replacement/close while readers share it; the registry refcounts identity so a waiter can never have its lease entry reclaimed and swapped underneath it (no ABA); multi-server operations take leases in sorted name order. | registry 402-546 (`getRetained` 498, `retain` 512, `release` 523), add retains entry across init 4194-4212, sorted multi-lock 665-681 | TestLeaseRegistryReclaimsChurnAndProtectsWaiterFromABA, TestAddServerRetainsLeaseAcrossRemoveDuringInitialization, TestSuccessfulAddRemoveReclaimsEveryLeaseReference, TestCanceledAddAfterRetainReclaimsUniqueLeaseReferences, TestAddRollbackConsumesItsLastLeaseReferenceOnce, TestReplaceServerAcquiresLeasesInSortedNameOrder (sorted-order clause, lock_discipline_test.go) | `92f2ee9a` (refcounted registry), `2c23fcd3` (ABA-safe `retain` bool) |
| INV-08 | For one server name, the durable config commit, the runtime swap, and the subscriber-visible events form one linearization point against concurrent remove/disable/add — a remove can never interleave between an Add's disk commit and its publication, and a same-name Add cannot start before subscribers have seen the deletion. | `publishPreparedClientLocked` contract 3172-3176, publish paths 3078-3121 / 4279-4341; remove publish-in-lease 4573-4577; replace events-before-unlock 4039-4041 | TestAddLinearizesPublicationBeforeConcurrentRemoveAfterCommit, TestRemovePublishesBeforeBlockedCloseAndConcurrentAdd (zz_commit_outcome_test.go), TestRemoveDisabledFallbackPublishesOneStateEvent, TestStartFallbackDisabledPublishesBeforeLeaseUnlock, TestReplacePublishesBeforeBlockedCloseAndConcurrentRemove, TestStartFallbackDoesNotReplaceNewerSession (event_order_test.go) | `46f68de7` (commit+publish one lease turn), `49c92cb1` (remove event), `a62a37e6` (replacement events), `62371a33` (pinned against disk) |
| INV-09 | Replacement connects and promotes the new session before the durable rename commits, then switches config, session, advertised data, and state as one transition; any pre-commit failure leaves the old server exactly as it was. | `ReplaceServer` contract 3665-3669, flow 3825-3977 (promote 3841-3848, no-lifecycleMu persist 3863-3868, publication 3912-3977) | TestReplaceServerFailedSameNamePreservesLiveServerAndDisk, TestReplaceServerFailedRenamePreservesLiveServerAndDisk, TestReplaceServerSuccessfulSwapPublishesNewSessionOnce, TestReplaceServerSuccessfulRenameRemovesOnlyOldRuntimeState, TestReplaceServerPersistenceFailurePreservesOldAdmissionAndCallbacks (transactional_update_test.go) | `cf12608e` (transactional replace), `71df8f19` (admission survival), `14b8677d` (inactive replacements finalized) |
| INV-10 | A rename replacement is fenced on both identities — source and destination — so a concurrent change or uncertainty on either name invalidates the candidate before the durable commit. | `bindGuardLocked` 1216-1226, `replacementNamesValidLocked` 1253-1272, guard use 3803-3810 + 3915-3917 | TestReplaceServerConditionalTargetCollisionPreservesOldRuntime, TestReplacedRenameAdmissionTracksCommittedConfig, TestReplaceRejectsPendingAddDestinationBeforePreparation, TestReplaceRejectsDestinationFenceRaisedDuringPreparation | `59d1d8d9` (rename/rollback fences), `c7dfca65` (stale replacement results fenced) |
| INV-11 | An Add is a transaction: its prepared client is invisible (no session, tools, prompts, state, or events) until the durable outcome is known, and a rollback removes only that exact transaction — once a user mutation or durable commit has touched the name, rollback is a no-op. | `addTransaction` 1023-1039, staging 3200-3206, staged publish 4334-4341, `rollbackAddedServer` guards 4382-4385 + 4416-4445 | TestAddPrecommitFailureDoesNotPublishPreparedRuntime, TestTypedPrecommitOutcomeDoesNotCommitAdd, TestStaleAddRollbackPreservesNewerSameNameServer, TestPendingAddRemoveRejectsDurableCollision, TestAddCloseRollsBackCanceledPendingConfig | `9d1a6f2f` (transaction closes after durable outcome), `cf12608e`/`71df8f19` (transactional ground work) |
| INV-12 | Disable and remove persist before invalidating: only after the durable write is known-good may runtime state be torn down, so a failed persistence leaves the session enabled with no half-applied result — and for an in-flight pending Add, the disable/remove is one conditional durable write with no enabled window on disk. | persist-first 3378-3380 + 3427-3433, 4607-4613; pending-add one-write 3380-3386 + 4541-4582 | TestPendingAddMutationCommitsCompleteConfigBeforeInvalidatingAdd, TestPendingAddRemoveUsesOneConditionalWriteWithoutEnabledWindow, TestPendingAddDisableUsesOneWriteAndPreservesConcurrentWriter, TestDisableServerCancelsBlockedInitAndLeavesNoLateSession, TestExternalDisableKeepsFullDefinitionAndUsesWorkspaceOverlay | `779e323b` (atomic pending disables), `950c1a04` (single conditional write) |
| INV-13 | A failed Enable either restores the exact prior durable state (checked by generation/CAS) or fences the runtime — it never leaves a half-applied enable, and a rollback that would clobber a concurrent writer aborts into an uncertainty fence instead. | rollback machinery 3534-3570, generation check 3592-3597, uncertainty branches 3613-3617 | TestEnableRollbackPreservesConcurrentDefinitionAndFencesStore, TestEnablePendingGlobalAddRollbackRestoresDisabledDefinition, TestEnableRollbackUncertaintySurvivesOwnerRolloverUntilExactReload | `6c15f330` (conditional rollback), `59d1d8d9` (rollback race fences) |
| INV-14 | A durable outcome that cannot be read back (maybe-committed, or committed-but-unreconciled) fences the runtime — detach, disable, mark uncertain — instead of guessing, inferring config, or starting a fallback. | `fenceMCPRuntimeLocked` 4671-4685 (`MarkMCPUncertain` 4674), `commitOutcomeNeedsRuntimeFence` 4840-4846, `ErrMCPConfigUncertain` 783-785 | TestCommittedUnreconciledOutcomesFenceRuntime, TestMaybeCommittedAddFencesUntilReload … TestMaybeCommittedReplaceFencesUntilReload (zz_commit_outcome_test.go), TestUnreconciledCommitBlocksReadmissionUntilReloadReconciliation, TestDisableRechecksUncertaintyAfterWaitingForLease | `b639b317` (fence uncertain mutations), `c4440e60` (typed outcomes), `98f769e7` (reconcile uncertain commits) |
| INV-15 | The uncertainty fence lives in the config store, not the owner: it survives owner rollover and a reload of a different store, and is cleared only by a successful disk reload whose version check proves the fence was not raised while the read was in flight. | capture + version check 1965-2004, admissions reject uncertain 1389-1391, 2826-2835, 5028-5044 | TestMaybeCommittedFenceSurvivesOwnerRollover, TestWrongStoreReloadDoesNotClearMCPFence, TestReloadAndReconcilePreservesFenceRaisedDuringFinalize, TestEnableRollbackUncertaintySurvivesOwnerRolloverUntilExactReload (uncertainty_fence_test.go) | `da066d7f` (uncertainty moved out of the replaceable snapshot into the store — closed a real fence-loss hole) |
| INV-16 | A list-changed notification driven by an unpublished candidate session is deferred, attached to that exact candidate token (never inferred from the name), published only after that candidate commits, and discarded if the candidate dies. | `refreshRequest.deferUntilCommit/candidateToken` 1093-1107, defer 6013-6027, activation gate 1765-1775, `activateRefreshesLocked` 1831-1871, discard 1885-1891 | TestCandidateListChangedIsRetainedUntilExactCommit, TestFailedCandidateListChangedDropsDeferredEvent, TestCandidateListChangedPublishesAfterCommitAndRefreshesNewSession, TestInitializeSingleDefersCandidateNotificationWithOldSameNameSession, TestReplacementCandidateListChangedUsesCommittedDestinationAdmission, TestInitializeSingleFailedCandidateDropsNotification | `6c2030dd` (defer until commit), `646b0f49` (promotion/notification linearization) |
| INV-17 | Refresh work is coalesced per (name, kind, epoch, candidate): at most one run in flight, later notifications mark it dirty for exactly one rerun, a saturated wake channel drops nothing because the pending map is the authoritative queue, and each rerun is re-admitted under the same epoch fencing as a session. | `enqueueRefreshLocked` 1798-1817 (dirty marker 1812-1815), `signalRefresh` 1819-1826, `runRefresh` re-admission 1906-1945, key 1893-1904 | TestListChangedDuringRefreshSchedulesDirtyRerun, TestRefreshQueueSaturationCoalescesWithoutDropping, TestDirtyRefreshFailuresRetainCurrentSession, TestListChangedRefreshIsAsyncAndStaleAdmissionIsIgnored, TestExportedRefreshFailuresRetainSessionCountsAndRecover | `92f2ee9a` (refresh queue + worker), `2c23fcd3` (authoritative pending map after buffer-overflow loss), `5da43c1a` (exported refresh fenced) |
| INV-18 | State transitions are published only by the admission that owns the state token: suppressed or invalidated candidates publish nothing, and Starting is resolved to Error/Disabled only by its own admission — state never infers session identity from a previous state's Client field. | `admissionStateEventUnpinned` 5554-5570, suppress flags 1134-1135, `cleanupFailedAdmission` token ownership 5574-5610, `setState` 5497-5510 | TestStaleAdmissionCleanupLeavesNoOwnerlessStarting, TestInvalidCommittedNotificationClearsAllAdvertisedData, TestReplacePublishesStateEventsForResultBranches, TestInitializeSingleDisabledDetachesPublishedRuntime (event_order_test.go) | `92f2ee9a` (per-admission state), `1bf8bcdc` (removed the heuristic that inferred ownership from previous state) |
| INV-19 | At most one renewal of a server's session runs at a time: concurrent callers wait for the renewal winner instead of failing or renewing in parallel, and an in-flight operation pins its session generation so retirement cancels the operation's context while the transport survives until the last pinned operation releases. | single-flight 569-590, follower waits 5110-5126 + 5208-5253, ping-fail detach 5270-5287; operation pinning 163-227 | TestGetOrRenewClientWaitsForDetachedRenewalWinner (renewal_followup_test.go), TestRenewalRetainsLeaseIdentityUntilAfterPublish, TestOperationLeaseDefersCloseUntilFinalReference, TestClientLeaseProtectsOperationFromRenewalAndClose, TestDisableCancelsRenewalAndReleasesFollowers, TestOperationLeaseRetiresBlockedCallWithoutWriterConvoy, TestRetiredSessionsCancelBeforeABlockedClose | `e3b79c04` (operation leases; closed the CR-4 reader convoy), `70c98f828` (restored follower wait after `3c3b7dde` had reordered it — CH5-2) |
| INV-20 | Every HTTP request of a session stays cancellable by the admission context that created it — including requests blocked before a response on Windows (explicit CancelRequest) and responses whose body is still being read (the fence follows the body until close/EOF). | `headerRoundTripper.RoundTrip` 6286-6350 (fence comment 6322-6327), `ownerResponseBody` 6259-6284, per-transport pool 5967-5984 | TestHeaderRoundTripperCancelsBlockedRequestBeforeResponse, TestHeaderRoundTripperKeepsOwnerCancellationUntilBodyClose, TestOwnerResponseBodyCloseCancelsBeforeUnderlyingClose, TestHeaderRoundTripperUsesOwnedTransportPool, TestCreateTransport_PreCanceledContextWinsFieldValidation | `92f2ee9a` (owned pool + explicit cancel), `2de9d044` (bounded admission I/O lifecycle), `49e008fa` (strict oracles) |
| INV-21 | A stdio MCP server's entire process tree dies with the session context (own process group, group kill) — not just the direct child — and the failure-diagnostic re-run of the command is bounded in both output bytes and time. | process-group comment + call 6160-6165 (`configureStdioProcess`), diagnostics 6356-6417 + 6460-6478, limits 380-382 | TestCreateTransport_StdioProcessGroup (process_unix_test.go), TestConfigureStdioProcess_CancelTreeKillsOrphanedGrandchild_Windows, TestStdioCheckBoundsDiagnosticOutput, TestStdioDiagnosticWriterLimitAndConcurrency | `b956dacb` (ported tree-kill; upstream `132a8c89`; 15+ production zombies motivated it), `c96eaa4d` (bounded diagnostics) |
| INV-22 | `WaitForInit` blocks only while a real full initialization is in flight: the barrier is created lazily, single-server operations never own it, it is reopened by a later full Initialize, and it is closed before the init wait group drains so waiters can never hang on a dying owner's channel. | lazy barrier 2232-2250, close 2265-2284, `WaitForInit` 2780-2790, shutdown close 2488 | TestWaitForInitIsImmediateWithoutFullInitialize, TestSequentialInitializeReopensInitBarrier, TestInitializeSingleDoesNotOwnInitBarrier, TestInitializeBarrierIsGenerationScopedAcrossRollover, TestInitializeClosesBarrierBeforeInitWaitGroup (init_test.go/state_regression_test.go) | `3199bf34` (reopen; CR-3 closure leg), `922316af` (lazy barrier + shutdown close) |
| INV-23 | The global-scope fallback for an unowned in-memory MCP definition is granted only to a registered in-flight Add transaction; every other unwritable-origin definition fails closed. | `resolveMCPMutationScope` 4073-4092 (authorization 4084-4091), `hasPendingGlobalAddFor` 4098-4107, sole `markPendingGlobalAdd` call 4186 | TestBlockedProjectInitializerIsNotPendingGlobalAdd, TestProjectMCPMutationsFailClosed, TestWorkspaceDisableEnableRemovePersistInWorkspaceFile, TestReplaceServerProjectOriginRejectsBeforeCandidateConnection | `95faff44` (restricted fallback to pending adds), `f11d8fed` (origin-scoped mutations) |
| INV-24 | A published session is retired only when its own effective definition diverges from what it was connected with — unrelated config writes, other servers' mutations, and no-op reloads must not disturb it. | `committedValidLocked` + `mcpConnectionConfigEqual` 1327-1366 (definition equality, not revision counters), `getOrRenewClientOnce` pre-ping fence 5086-5101 | TestPublishedHTTPNotificationSurvivesUnrelatedReload, TestGetOrRenewFencesStaleCommittedSessionBeforePing, TestReloadFencesPublishedSessionAfterRelevantMCPChange, TestRenewedSessionNotificationSurvivesConfigMutations, TestMCPAdmissionSurvivesUnrelatedCOWUpdate | `f2914d53c` ("preserve MCP session identity across revisions") |
| INV-25 | The source bytes a session is admitted from are captured under the server lease and revalidated at the final publication boundary; a no-op reload does not invalidate the candidate, but a semantic change to the definition or its resolved values fails the admission (stale) and the caller retries with a fresh disk snapshot a bounded number of times. | `withMCPAdmissionFinalTurn` 2058-2091, revision pinning 1288-1298, bounded retry 2887-2928 + 2937-2969 | TestMCPAdmissionFinalSourceLinearizationRejectsInPlaceChanges, TestMCPAdmissionFinalSourceLinearizationRejectsExpectedAbsentCreation, TestInitializeSlowCandidateSurvivesNoOpReload, TestReplaceAllowsNoOpReloadDuringPreparation, TestInitializeRejectsSemanticResolverChangeAndRetriesFreshCandidate, TestMCPAdmissionFinalTurnValidatesAfterLifecycleAcquisition, TestCreateTransport_PassesLifetimeContextToEveryRuntimeField, TestGetOrRenewClientBoundsCrossStoreChurn | `779802b2` (revisions; introduced CH5-3 over-fencing), `00c9911f5` (no-op vs semantic distinction — CH5-3 closed), `87de26a7` (revalidate all sources), `d2288666` (final source linearization) |

## Classification: S / M / X (stage 1.3)

Task #904. The question asked of every row: if the nine package globals of
`init.go:366-377` were fields of one `Owner` — only `currentOwner *Owner` and
its swap mutex left at package level, the 27 exported functions thin wrappers
over `currentOwner()` — could the law still be broken? If the only way to break
it required two owners sharing process-global state, it is **S** (structural:
the guard becomes unreachable and can be deleted). If it constrains ordering or
exclusion within a single owner, it is **M** (mechanical: the mechanism stays,
localized). **X** (speculative: no observable failure, no test) — none found,
consistent with stage 1.2's zero-vacuous result. Verdicts were decided by
reading the code each row points at, at HEAD `d181f3942`; tests staying green
proves nothing about a law that has become unreachable, so no verdict rests on
test outcomes. This section only labels laws; designing the target structure is
stage 2's job.

Five rows are mixed (one clause structural, one mechanical) and are split
rather than force-labelled: INV-02, INV-03, INV-04, INV-15, INV-22. "Structural
at" names the plan §2.3 migration step after which the S-law is unbreakable.

| ID | Class | Structural at (§2.3) | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| INV-01 | M | — | The law binds the caller/admission/init-timeout contexts of a single owner's in-flight initialization (promote handoff 5768-5797); no owner pair is involved, so the handoff mechanism must stay. |
| INV-02a | S | 3.8 (`owner`+`lifecycleMu`) | With per-Owner state an old owner's work can only touch its own fields, so "all state belongs to exactly one active Owner" holds by construction and the `owner == o` guards (1383, 1947-1949, 2481) plus the cross-owner filtering rationale become dead. |
| INV-02b | M | — | An `Owner` still binds its ConfigStore lazily (`rememberConfig` 2212-2214; `Acquire()` takes no store) and the implicit owner must still be proven empty before replacement (`canReclaimLocked` 1662-1678, `acquire` 1684-1697) or an abandoned owner leaks live transports/processes — both ordering laws within one owner's lifetime. |
| INV-03a | S | 3.1+3.7 (`stateOwners`, `sessions`) | The `owner == a.owner` and generation legs of validity (1299-1301, 1337-1339) exist only so a stale admission cannot reach a shared registry; owner-relative state makes them tautological (deletable at 3.8). |
| INV-03b | M | — | Epoch invalidation with bump-only-after-durable-write (1392-1398) and cancel-without-bump (1630-1640) is ordering among a single owner's own mutations. |
| INV-04a | M | — | Joining every admitted init, refresh worker and session close before reset (2436-2478), plus the within-owner closing fence, is resource-lifecycle ordering inside the dying owner; removing it leaks transports/processes even with no second owner. |
| INV-04b | S | 3.7 (`sessions`) | The expired-deadline fence's stated purpose — old-owner callbacks must not mutate the next owner's registry (2409-2415, `if owner == o` 2481) — becomes unreachable when callbacks cannot address another owner's fields. |
| INV-05 | M | — | Disable/remove of server A racing publish/renew of server B hits the same `committedAdmissions` map of the SAME owner, so the exclusion survives per-Owner state untouched. |
| INV-06 | M | — | Lease-before-`lifecycleMu` order, no-I/O-under-lock and cancel-outside-lock are lock discipline inside one owner (4687-4696, 6077-6079); the migration neither enforces nor removes them. |
| INV-07 | M | — | Refcounted lease identity, ABA protection and (untested) sorted multi-lock order are mechanisms of one owner's registry with no cross-owner clause. |
| INV-08 | M | — | Commit/publish/events as one linearization point against same-name remove/add is ordering under one name's lease inside one owner. |
| INV-09 | M | — | Transactional replace (promote-before-commit, single transition, no half-applied failure) is a multi-step ordering law within one owner. |
| INV-10 | M | — | Dual-identity (source+destination) fencing guards one owner's rename against its own concurrent mutations. |
| INV-11 | M | — | Add-as-transaction with guarded rollback is staging and cleanup discipline within one owner. |
| INV-12 | M | — | Persist-before-invalidate and the pending-add one-write are durability ordering between one owner and its store, and the store is outside the migration's scope. |
| INV-13 | M | — | Conditional enable rollback (CAS-or-fence) arbitrates concurrent writers on one owner's store. |
| INV-14 | M | — | The unreadable-outcome fence acts through the ConfigStore (`MarkMCPUncertain` 4674), which stays; the fail-closed discipline is unchanged by ownership. |
| INV-15a | S | none — pre-existing | The fence already lives on the ConfigStore (`internal/config/mcp_uncertainty.go:88`), not in any of the nine globals, so "survives rollover" holds by placement today and after the migration; nothing becomes deletable — stage 2 must simply never move it into `Owner`. |
| INV-15b | M | — | The version-check clear discipline (capture before reload 1965-1976; clear-only-versions-observed-before-the-read, `store_reload.go:356`/`587`) is a real ordering mechanism on the store and survives the migration untouched. |
| INV-16 | M | — | Candidate-token deferral, activation and discard are publication ordering within one owner. |
| INV-17 | M | — | Refresh coalescing, dirty-rerun and re-admission are mechanisms of one owner's queue and epochs. |
| INV-18 | M | — | State-event token ownership is exclusion among one owner's admissions. |
| INV-19 | M | — | Renewal single-flight and operation pinning are exclusion/ordering within one owner's sessions. |
| INV-20 | M | — | HTTP cancellation fencing is transport-lifetime binding within one admission; owners are irrelevant to it. |
| INV-21 | M | — | Stdio process-group kill and bounded diagnostics are transport-level laws with no owner dimension at all. |
| INV-22a | M | — | Lazy barrier creation, reopen per full init, and close-before-initWG-drain (2232-2284, 2488) are close-ordering inside one owner. |
| INV-22b | S | 3.3 (`initDone`) | The barrier channel is already per-owner (`o.initDone`); its cross-rollover leg is carried only by the package mirror (`initDone = o.initDone` 1725/2244, read by `WaitForInit` 2782, reset 2486), which dies when `initDone` moves. |
| INV-23 | M | — | Granting the global-scope fallback only to a registered pending Add (`resolveMCPMutationScope` 4073-4092) is an authorization law inside one owner's mutation flow; ownership placement neither enforces nor removes it. |
| INV-24 | M | — | Retire-on-definition-divergence (`mcpConnectionConfigEqual` 1327-1366) judges one owner's published session against its own store; unrelated-write tolerance is within-owner semantics, not cross-owner isolation. |
| INV-25 | M | — | Source capture under the lease, final-turn revalidation and bounded retry (2058-2091, 2887-2969) order one owner's admission against the store and disk, which the migration does not touch. |

### Summary

| Class | Count | IDs |
|---|---|---|
| S | 5 | INV-02a, INV-03a, INV-04b, INV-15a (pre-existing), INV-22b |
| M | 25 | 20 whole rows (01, 05-14, 16-21, 23-25) + halves 02b, 03b, 04a, 15b, 22a |
| X | 0 | — |

X is empty and that is the finding, not an omission: stage 1.2 found zero
vacuous tests, and the two NO-TEST clauses (INV-06 no-I/O-under-lock, INV-07
sorted lease order) are clauses of M laws, not speculative guards.

S-invariants in the order the migration makes them structural (plan §2.3 step
order):

1. INV-22b — step 3.3 (`initDone`).
2. INV-03a — steps 3.1+3.7 (`stateOwners`, `sessions`); guard text deletable
   at 3.8.
3. INV-04b — step 3.7 (`sessions`).
4. INV-02a — step 3.8 (`owner` + `lifecycleMu`, last).
5. INV-15a — no step: pre-existing structural law (fence on the store);
   migration-neutral.

**M > 10 — the stage-3 `init.go` < 2000-line target must be revisited.** The
plan expected M 5-8 with S the majority; the code says the opposite: 20 of 25
laws are wholly mechanical and 5 more carry a mechanical half. The lease
registry, admissions, transactions, refresh queue, promote handoff, transport
fences and the rest of the M machinery are the bulk of the ~5800 added lines,
and the ownership migration simplifies them (drops cross-owner branches) but
deletes none of them; the only guard code the migration removes is the small S
set above. "< 2000 = upstream 1391 + an honest allowance" was priced for an
S-majority registry, so stage 2 should re-derive the line budget by counting
which guard bodies implement S-laws versus M-laws before committing to a
number.

Findings about the plan's assumed structure, for stage 2 to resolve (not
redesigned here):

- The shared-state set is 12 package globals, not nine: `allTools`
  (tools.go:29), `allPrompts` (prompts.go:16) and `allResources`
  (resources.go:21) are consulted by `canReclaimLocked` (init.go:1666-1668),
  cleared by `resetRegistryLocked` (2504-2512) and read by the exported
  getters. No S-law above is fully unbreakable until these three move too.
- INV-02a's isolation payoff holds only while consumers route through their
  acquired `*Owner`. Under thin wrappers over `currentOwner()`, a second
  ConfigStore in one process (the SDK multi-App case that motivated
  `07a69d8f`) still reaches the current owner's registry through name-only
  getters, so the `IsConfigured` per-store filtering convention
  (init.go:2599-2610) may remain necessary even after the migration.
- Step 3.2 (`broker`) carries no S-conversion: the broker is already shut down
  and recreated at registry reset (init.go:2514-2515), so no invariant depends
  on cross-rollover event continuity.

## Test → invariant map

Task #903, stage 1.2. One row per test function in
`internal/agent/tools/mcp/*_test.go` (as of worktree HEAD `b35c13ab6`, branch
`p903-test-invariant-map`). Verdicts:

- **INV-NN** — the test would fail if that invariant were violated. The first
  ID is the primary law; parenthesised IDs are secondary laws the same test pins.
- **MACHINERY** — no registry law behind it. None of these are fence
  bookkeeping; they are transport/tool feature pins that do not touch the nine
  package globals stage 3 migrates, so they are stage-3 neutral.
- **VACUOUS** — would pass with the behaviour it names removed. **None found**
  (method below).
- Two functions named `Test*` are subprocess helpers, not tests; they are
  listed for completeness and excluded from all counts.

### Summary

| Verdict | Count |
|---|---|
| INV-NN (one primary per test) | 219 |
| MACHINERY | 10 |
| VACUOUS | 0 |
| Real tests | 229 |
| Helpers named `Test*` (not tests) | 2 |

Count vs baseline (230 via `go test -list '.*'` on Windows, see
`docs/plans/mcp-consolidation-baseline.md`): 230 = 229 real tests + 2 helpers.
The helpers are `TestMCPStdioHelper` (state_regression_test.go:1866) and
`TestMCPStdioDiagnosticHelper` (stdio_diagnostic_test.go:24) — subprocess
helpers selected by env var; when the suite runs them as tests they exit
immediately and pass. `TestMain` (process_windows_test.go) is not listed by
`go test -list`. Build-tagged files swap one test per platform
(`TestCreateTransport_StdioProcessGroup` is `!windows`,
`TestConfigureStdioProcess_CancelTreeKillsOrphanedGrandchild_Windows` is
`windows`), so the count is identical on this Windows baseline.

**Invariants with zero non-vacuous tests: none.** Every INV-01..INV-25 has at
least one INV-verdict oracle. The two clause-level gaps stage 1.1 recorded stand
unchanged and are the complete 1.4 backlog: INV-06 "no I/O under
`lifecycleMu`/server lease", INV-07 "multi-server leases in sorted name order".

How verdicts were determined (reading only — no test was run, per task
constraints): every test was read in full including setup and helpers; a test
counts as INV-pinning only if an asserted postcondition would observably differ
if the law's guard were removed. Where that judgment needed production code, the
code was read: `startFallback`'s `reflect.DeepEqual` staleness guard
(init.go:4898) is what makes the `fallback_race_test.go` pair fail if removed;
`SetSkipPermissionRequests` (internal/config/store.go:354) performs a real
store COW write, so `TestMCPAdmissionSurvivesUnrelatedCOWUpdate` genuinely
discriminates definition-equality from snapshot identity. Caveats that are
flake/scope risks, not vacuity: four tests use timing-based negative windows
(100 ms polls, 25–50 ms sleeps); the three `committedAdmissions` oracles are
`-race` oracles and are only fully load-bearing under `-race`, which every
stage-3 step already mandates.

Names that promise more than their assertions pin (each still a real,
non-vacuous test — read the assertion, not the name, before leaning on it in
stage 3):

- `TestHeaderRoundTripperUsesOwnedTransportPool` — asserts only pointer
  inequality of two cloned transports; INV-20's behavioural follow-through is
  pinned by its siblings.
- `TestInitialize_RestrictToCLIEnabled` — infers "connection attempted"
  indirectly (`State != Disabled` against a command that is not an MCP server).
- `TestMCPAdmissionSurvivesUnrelatedCOWUpdate` — a single `admission.valid()`
  call; the discrimination only works together with the negative
  store-generation siblings.
- `TestOwnerCloserUsesOneWorkerForBlockedRetirements` — the drain assertion is
  INV-04; the "exactly one worker" half pins closer-worker bookkeeping and will
  need rewriting if stage 3 reshapes the closer, with no law lost.

Seam-coupled oracles (stage-3 caution — these are INV-verdicts, not MACHINERY):
many tests are wired through production test seams — `serverLeaseHooks`,
`mcpInitTestHooks`, `addAdmissionHooks`, `resourcesBeforePublishHook`,
`mcpReloadAfterSuccessHook`, and the `renewalWaitHook` / `renewalBeginHook` /
`renewalPublishHook` / `renewalEndHook` fields on `serverLease`. If stage 3
moves or removes the seams while migrating `leases`/`owner`, those tests stop
compiling; that is a mechanical rewrite, never bookable as lost coverage. The
deepest mechanism-coupled oracles: `TestRenewalRetainsLeaseIdentityUntilAfterPublish`
(asserts exact lease refcounts 3→3→2→1 through renewal hooks) and
`TestCanceledAddAfterRetainReclaimsUniqueLeaseReferences` (256 iterations via
`addAdmissionHooks`).

## NO-TEST findings — closed by stage 1.4 (task #905)

Both clause-level gaps below were closed by the new file
`internal/agent/tools/mcp/lock_discipline_test.go`. This supersedes the
stage-1.2 statement that the two gaps "stand unchanged and are the complete
1.4 backlog". Both new tests are revert-checked: each was shown to fail when
its guarded behaviour was temporarily broken, and to pass again after a
byte-exact restore.

- INV-07, "multi-server operations take leases in sorted name order":
  COVERED by `TestReplaceServerAcquiresLeasesInSortedNameOrder`. It drives a
  rename `ReplaceServer` whose call site passes (oldName, newName) in reverse
  lexical order (`zz-order-source` → `aa-order-target`), records every lease
  acquisition attempt through `serverLeaseHooks.beforeTryLockFn`, and asserts
  the observed order is the sorted order. Removing `slices.Sort` from
  `lockServerLeasesContext` fails the test with the two names swapped. The
  test pins the shared sort inside `lockServerLeasesContext`, so both
  multi-name lock rounds of ReplaceServer — and any future caller of that
  helper — are covered by construction.
- INV-06, "no network or disk I/O while holding `lifecycleMu` or a server
  lease": COVERED NARROWLY, at two of the call sites the invariant names.
  - `TestReplacePersistRunsOutsideLifecycleLock` probes `lifecycleMu` free at
    the durable replacement write (the injected `persist` seam of
    `replaceServerWithResultPersistenceAndPreparation`). The ordered server
    leases are held at that seam by design ("Keep the ordered server leases,
    but never hold lifecycleMu here") and are deliberately not probed there.
  - `TestUncertaintyReloadRunsOutsideLifecycleLocks` probes `lifecycleMu` and
    every lease entry in the registry write-free at the uncertainty reload's
    finalize seam (`mcpReloadAfterSuccessHook` in
    `reloadWithUncertaintyToken`), with a live seeded lease entry so the
    lease leg cannot pass vacuously.
  - Revert-checks: holding `lifecycleMu` across the persist call, or across
    the reload and its finalization, makes the respective test fail in under
    a second with the held lock named.

  REMAINING UNCOVERED, stated precisely:
  - The general law is not directly assertable in Go; only instrumented seams
    are oracles. Other I/O sites — the network connect in candidate
    preparation, and the persist seams of add/enable/disable/remove — have no
    lock probe.
  - The reload observation point is the finalize seam AFTER the disk read
    returns. A regression that holds `lifecycleMu` only around the raw read
    and releases before finalization would not be caught; a hold through
    finalization — the realistic shape — is caught. Holding it through the
    whole function is independently impossible: `reconcilePublishedSessions`
    re-takes `lifecycleMu` and self-deadlocks (the deferred-hold revert-check
    demonstrated this as a 10-minute test hang — itself evidence the lock
    discipline is load-bearing).
  - The probes test the write side only; read-locked (RLock) lease holders
    are not probed anywhere.

## Review-vs-code notes

- Chunk-5 review (2026-09-07) listed CH5-1 (P0 `committedAdmissions` race),
  CH5-2 (P2 renewal wait), and CH5-3 (P1 no-op reload kills candidates) as
  open. All three are closed on this HEAD, verified in code and via git:
  CH5-1 by `00c9911f5` (+ oracles `0175b1e0`), CH5-2 by `70c98f828`, CH5-3 by
  `00c9911f5`. Their mechanisms remain accurate descriptions of WHY the laws
  above exist.
- The 36h review's CR-1..CR-4 closure claims were re-verified against this
  HEAD's code (sessionContext/promote chain, renewal lifetime, lazy barrier,
  operation leases): all confirmed. No review claim was found to contradict
  the code as read.

## Commit → invariant

Reading `git log -- internal/agent/tools/mcp/` through this table. Most
commits have empty bodies; the reasoning lives here and in
`docs/reviews/2026-09-05-2047-commit-review-36h.md` (CR-1..CR-4) and the five
2026-09-07 chunk reviews (CH5-*).
