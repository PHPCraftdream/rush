// newLockTestSessionAgent builds the minimal *sessionAgent needed to drive
// Run() as far as the inter-process session-lock check (agent.go ~470-543)
// without panicking on a nil csync field. Bare &sessionAgent{} (the pattern
// used by convert_test.go / usage_fallback_test.go) is NOT enough here:
// Run() calls a.tryReserveSession, which calls a.getMailbox, which calls
// a.mailboxes.GetOrSet — a nil *csync.Map receiver panics (nil pointer
// dereference inside sync.RWMutex), so mailboxes must be initialized the
// same way NewSessionAgent does. activeRequests is initialized too since
// Cancel and OnStepFinish's abort-path cancel lookups still read it.
// tools/
// largeModel/smallModel/systemPrompt/systemPromptPrefix are initialized too
// because Run's very next block after the lock section resolves the turn's
// config snapshot (agent.go's resolveTurnConfig, task #265) and
// unconditionally dereferences all four — needed only by
// TestRun_SubAgentChildSession_ProceedsPastLockWhenFree, which drives Run()
// past the lock into that code; harmless no-ops for the lock-rejection test,
// which returns before reaching that point.
//
// smallModel joined that list with #265: before it, small was read lazily
// inside generateTitle (which none of these tests reach), so leaving it nil
// was survivable. The snapshot now reads every field ONCE at turn start —
// that is the whole point, since a concurrent session can rewrite the shared
// fields mid-turn — so a nil here panics instead of silently not mattering.

// TestRun_SubAgentChildSession_RejectsWhenLockHeldByAnotherProcess is the
// regression test for P1.1 (docs/reviews/2026-07-30-project-review.md,
// commit 18055ba0, task #163) that actually drives agent.Run itself, rather
// than only the lock primitive it depends on (which
// session.TestCrossProcess_SubAgentChildSessionIsProtected already covers).
//
// Before the fix, sessionAgent.Run's inter-process lock acquisition was
// gated by `if !a.isSubAgent && a.dataDir != ""`, so a sub-agent's Run call
// never took the lock for its own CHILD session id (format
// "parentMessageID$$toolCallID", see session.CreateAgentToolSessionID) at
// all. This test simulates "another crush process already holds the lock
// for this exact child session id" by acquiring the lock directly from the
// test (standing in for the other process) before calling Run, and asserts
// Run refuses to proceed — returning the same "already in use" error a
// top-level session would get — instead of silently streaming into an
// already-claimed session.

// intermittently won the race for the still-free lock before Run's own
// goroutine got scheduled, starving Run's real attempt and producing a
