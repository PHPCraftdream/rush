// the agent asked a question and this fork's `rush run` has no synchronous
// way to block mid-turn for an answer (both headless and web sessions
// auto-approve permissions unconditionally; there is no blocking
// permission-style channel to wait on). The turn must end cleanly instead,
// with enough information for an orchestrating agent (or a human operator)
// to answer and resume.
//
// This is the single source of truth for the guidance text, mirroring
// PeakHoursGuidance in peak_hours_stop.go: the question-tool's finish-part
// writer and any stderr/CLI surface should call this instead of composing
// their own prose, so the wording stays identical everywhere it appears.

// subAgentQuestionText builds the tool-result text runSubAgent returns when
// a sub-agent (the `agent` tool) stops on AwaitingAnswerError instead of
// finishing normally. Sibling to AwaitingAnswerGuidance above: that function
// is for the top-level session stopping rush run itself (nobody left to
// answer, process must exit); this one is for a sub-agent stopping while its
// orchestrator is still alive and mid-turn — the orchestrator can decide the
// answer itself and keep going without its own turn ending. Wording matters
// here: this is read by a model, and the whole point of the "return and
// resume" design (see docs/plans/2026-07-26-orchestrator-worker-e2e.md,
// section 3) is that a generic-looking error would make the parent think the
// sub-agent crashed and redo the work itself instead of answering — so this
// must read unambiguously as "the sub-agent is fine and paused, not failed".
