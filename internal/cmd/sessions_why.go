var sessionsWhyCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "why <id>",
	Short: "Explain why a session has the status it has",
	Long: `Print a one-shot diagnostic from the current batch-node read, the
session lock, and the shared session-activity classifier. It reads the
session's recorded ended_reason, session lock files (in the default layout,
.rush/locks), and batch roots with read-only probes of per-process host
locks under .rush/hosts by default. A host lock is evidence about a batch
worker process, not the owner's session lock. This command does not use the
legacy async-job ledger and does not read external logs or orchestrator
redirect output.

The shared activity view is also used by "sessions list", "watch" and
the web surfaces. Live work (a live run driver, an own running job, a live
delegation, an open one-shot wake schedule, or unreadable live-work
evidence) keeps a session active. A held batch root takes precedence in
this command as "batch live"; an incomplete batch read is "batch unknown",
not proof that no work exists.

Status guidance:
  done       — no crash or live-work fact takes precedence, and an
               ended_reason is recorded. A finish such as end_turn only
               finishes an assistant turn; it is not by itself a session-end
               or task-completion signal.
  crashed    — a dead session-lock PID or driver marker naming a
               dead host is recorded, and neither live work nor incomplete
               batch evidence takes precedence.
  running    — the session lock is held or the session-activity view finds
               live work between turns (for example, its driver, own job, or
               open wake schedule).
  delegating (sessions list) — a live batch delegation is active; this
               command reports its held root as "batch live". The worker's
               per-process host lock is distinct from the owner's session lock.
  batch unknown — the batch read was incomplete; live batch work is unknown.
  at rest    — no live work or incomplete batch evidence is found, no crash
               fact takes precedence, and no ended_reason is recorded.

A stale/dead recorded PID is only an annotation when live work exists; it
does not override that work. The last assistant finish_reason is shown as
context, but only ended_reason records that the run ended. Treat these as
a snapshot of available evidence; they do not read external logs.`,

// directory (for the locks dir), the session id, and an output writer, so
// tests can drive it with a hand-built *app.App and a t.TempDir() without
// spinning up cobra.
//
// dataDir is the rush data directory itself (e.g. what
// a.Config().Options.DataDirectory resolves to — honoring --data-dir / a
// configured data_directory), NOT the project cwd: the lock file lives at
// <dataDir>/locks/session-<id>.lock, one level shallower than the old
// <cwd>/.rush/locks layout this parameter used to assume. See task #233
// (same cwd-hardcoding bug class as #219/#224/#231): the caller used to
// pass the raw --cwd value here, ignoring --data-dir entirely.
//
// The whole explanation is built from the batch facts, the session lock fact
// and the shared session-activity classifier (explainWhyBatch); no legacy
// async_jobs read runs.
