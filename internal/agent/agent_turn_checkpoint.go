// turnCheckpointWriter is runTurn's mid-stream persistence mechanism (Fork
// patch: batch 8 — auto-checkpoint state. See CHANGELOG.fork.md section 6).
// Split out of agent_turn.go's runTurn when the 1000-line limit landed:
// unlike runTurn's other callbacks, this one owns a genuinely self-contained
// slice of state (its own generation counter, stop/done channels and write
// cancel) and only READS the two things runTurn shares with it — sessionLock
// and the current assistant message — never owns them.
//
// Invariant: sessionLock protects EVERY touch of the current assistant
// message — mutation, Clone(), and even a bare len(Parts)/pointer read —
// because this writer's goroutine and the streaming callbacks (OnTextDelta,
// OnReasoningDelta, OnToolInputStart, ...) run concurrently on separate
// goroutines. message.Message.Clone() has no synchronization of its own, so
// a snapshot must be taken while holding sessionLock.
//
// The lock must NEVER be held across messages.Update (the SQLite write):
// the writer takes the lock, clones a private snapshot, releases the lock,
// then calls Update on the snapshot without the lock held. Otherwise each
// checkpoint tick would stall the whole streaming loop for the duration of
// a disk write. OnStepFinish drains the ticker and stops the goroutine
// (via stop()) before its final write; runTurn's own tail also calls
// stop() defensively before touching the assistant message, in case
// agent.Stream returned before OnStepFinish ever ran (e.g. the very first
// provider call failed).
//
// generation fences concurrent checkpoint writes across turns: each start()
// increments it, the goroutine captures the current value at launch, and
// stop() returns only after observing the goroutine's done signal. This
// ensures a hung checkpoint from turn N cannot race with a new checkpoint
// from turn N+1, and that stop()'s 5s timeout is reflected in the agent's
// runWg (see the P0-4 fix in start()'s write-context comment). mu
// synchronizes all access to generation; there is no shared
// checkpointPartsLen — each generation tracks its own lastPartsLen locally.
//
// stopCh and doneCh are reborn on every step. start() allocates a fresh
// pair and launches the ticker goroutine; stop() closes stopCh — the
// goroutine's dedicated exit signal — then waits on doneCh for it to
// actually exit, then nils both so the next step starts clean. The exit
// signal MUST be a dedicated channel, NOT genCtx.Done(): genCtx stays alive
// for the whole body of Run (cancelled only by the deferred cancel() at
// runTurn's return), so relying on it would force stop() to always hit its
// 5s backstop — the ~10s/turn stall this mechanism replaces. start/stop run
// on fantasy's single callback goroutine / the Run goroutine (never
// concurrent with each other); the ticker goroutine captures local channel
// refs at launch, so nil-ing the outer fields after stop does not affect
// it.
