# check_db_release_pairing.sh: guard against *_test.go files calling
# db.Connect()/db.ConnectRead() without pairing them with db.Release()
# in the same file -- the bug class behind the chronic ubuntu-latest
# CI kill documented in docs/lessons/2026-08-30-ci-goroutine-leak.md.
#
# Background: internal/db/connect.go's Connect/ConnectRead return
# handles from a process-wide REF-COUNTED pool (pool
# map[string]*connEntry, keyed by absolute database path). Every call
# increments the entry's refCount; only db.Release(dataDir) decrements
# it and (at zero) closes the underlying *sql.DB handles. A test that
# cleans up with conn.Close() on the raw *sql.DB compiles fine, looks
# correct, and is silently wrong: it bypasses the bookkeeping entirely,
# so the pool entry -- and, worse, its stdlib
# database/sql.(*DB).connectionOpener background goroutine, which only
# exits when the *sql.DB is closed via the correct API -- stays alive
# for the remaining life of the test binary. That leak was real and
# expensive: dozens of leaked connectionOpener goroutines across
# internal/agent's ~396 tests eventually starved GitHub hosted runners
# into killing the job (exit 143), a symptom that looked like pure
# runner flakiness for days. The compiler, go vet, and staticcheck all
# have no way to see the invariant -- it lives only in connect.go's doc
# comment -- so, exactly like the ASCII-SQL and stale-model-slot
# guards, a byte-level repo check is the only automated defense.
#
# Heuristic (same philosophy as this repo's other guards -- same-file
# occurrence counting, not static analysis): for every tracked
# *_test.go file that mentions db.Connect( or db.ConnectRead( at least
# once, count mentions of db.Release( and db.ReleaseAll( in the same
# file, with full-line // comments stripped first. If the release count
# is lower than the connect count, the file is a violation. Disclosed
# imprecision, accepted deliberately:
#   - It counts text, not dataflow. The refCount contract is per CALL
#     (connect.go: "one Connect, one Release", twice for a
#     Connect+ConnectRead pair), so counting calls is the right
#     granularity; but a mention inside a string literal, a /* */
#     block, or a trailing comment after code on the same line counts
#     too (only full-line // comments are stripped). If that ever
#     flags a correct file, fix the wording or extend the per-file
#     allow-list below -- do not delete the guard.
#   - db.ReleaseAll( counts as a release. It forcibly closes the entry
#     regardless of refCount, which is leak-safe even though it is not
#     the contractually preferred pairing; it exists precisely for
#     tests whose cleanup cannot know the live refCount (App.Shutdown's
#     forced-shutdown path deliberately skips Release -- see its doc
#     comment). internal/server/handlers_test.go is a legitimate user.
#   - db.ResetPool() deliberately does NOT count: it tears down every
#     pooled entry process-wide, which this repo's own comments
#     (internal/cmd/providers_cmd_test.go and friends) treat as the
#     wrong cleanup under t.Parallel(). A file pairing Connect with
#     ResetPool-only cleanup will be flagged on purpose; switch it to
#     db.Release/db.ReleaseAll.
#   - Only *_test.go files are scanned, and only the literal `db.`
#     qualifier. Package-internal callers in internal/db itself use
#     bare Connect(...) and are invisible here; production files are
#     skipped because App.Shutdown intentionally never calls Release in
#     its normal path, so a production scan would flag by design, not
#     by defect.
#   - A leak created via an indirect helper (test file A calls a
#     helper in file B that Connects and Releases) is invisible to a
#     same-file count by construction: the helper file carries both
#     sides, so it pairs.
#
# Implementation note: the per-file loop runs only over files that
# mention db.Connect/db.ConnectRead (~40 today), never over every
# tracked file -- see check_stale_model_slots.sh for why a whole-repo
# per-file loop is untenable (2500+ files, over a minute). Listing
# candidates with one `git grep -l` keeps this well under a second.

# Deliberately NOT `set -e`: this script is invoked two ways --
# directly by .githooks/pre-push (plain `bash

# runs under GitHub Actions' default `bash --noprofile --norc -eo
# pipefail {0}` -- but that parent -e does not propagate into a fresh
# `bash <file>` subprocess. This file's own `set` line is the only
