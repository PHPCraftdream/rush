package tools

// This file implements the shared batch runner for the scoped fs_* tool
// family: one place that owns the batch policy every fs_* tool inherits,
// the way multiedit.go is the one existing "N operations, one response,
// per-item outcome" tool.
//
// The policy, mirroring multiedit's two-phase shape:
//
//  1. Shape: the call is rejected whole (a level-1 error response,
//     before any per-item work) when it carries no items or more than
//     FSBatchMaxItems of them. Shape errors are wiring mistakes, not
//     policy decisions.
//  2. Pure preflight: every item is scope-checked and structurally
//     validated before ANY execution callback runs, so a batch that is
//     entirely out of scope does nothing and a partially out-of-scope
//     batch never executes a denied item. The runner itself does no
//     disk I/O during the preflight; a caller's Preflight may include
//     read-only existence checks (fs_write needs them to resolve
//     create-vs-overwrite) but must not mutate anything.
//  3. Best-effort execution: a failure on one item never blocks
//     unrelated items. Items whose resolved paths are equal form ONE
//     execution group and are handed to Execute together, so a caller
//     can apply N edits to one file in memory and write the file once
//     (one history version per file per call, as multiedit does).
//  4. The whole response is an error iff ZERO items succeeded —
//     multiedit's exact rule. StopTurn is never set here: a per-item
//     denial is model-correctable input, and only a whole-call
//     permissions.Request denial (the calling tool's concern) ends a
//     turn.
//  5. Every denied or failed item is slog.Warn-ed individually with
//     tool, session_id, path and op: the loggedTool wrapper
//     (internal/agent/logged_tool.go) only logs whole-response errors,
//     so without this a per-item denial inside an otherwise-successful
//     batch is invisible to the operator.
//
// Rendering split: the runner owns the deterministic summary (header
// line, one status line per item, the JSON metadata) and appends any
// per-item content blocks the Execute callback supplied (read-side
// tools render their own <file>...</file> blocks in view.go's shape;
// write-side tools normally supply none). Caps the runner cannot
// measure generically (grep matches per item, grep context radius) are
// reserved as named constants below for the calling tools to enforce.
