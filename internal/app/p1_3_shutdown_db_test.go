// TestP1_3_ShutdownDoesNotCloseDBUnderLiveWriter covers two of the three
// defects fixed in #343:
//   2. App.Shutdown distinguishes graceful vs forced shutdown
//   3. db.Release releases poolMu before calling sql.DB.Close()
//
// Defect 1 (CancelAll must be a true join on live Run() goroutines, not an
// IsBusy() poll) is NOT exercised here — the second subtest below drives
// App.Shutdown through a mockCoordinatorForShutdown that hardcodes
// stillBusy=true, so it proves Shutdown's OWN policy branch (skip DB close
// when told the agent is still busy) but says nothing about whether
// CancelAll correctly detects a genuinely stuck Run() in the first place.
// See TestP343_CancelAllTrueJoinWaitsForRealBlockedRun
// (internal/agent/p343_cancelall_join_test.go) for that proof: it drives a
// real sessionAgent.Run() deliberately stuck inside a tool call that ignores
// context cancellation, and asserts CancelAll genuinely blocks for close to
// its 5s grace period before reporting stillBusy=true.
//
// Both subtests below use real db.Connect/db.Release against real temp
// directories — not mocks of the DB layer — so they do prove the real pool
// mutex/Close() behavior for defects 2 and 3.
