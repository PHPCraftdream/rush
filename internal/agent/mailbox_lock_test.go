// TestMailbox_DrainOrReleaseFinal_OSLockReleasedBeforeStateFlipsIdle is the
// deterministic regression test for round 11 review, HIGH-1.
//
// Before the fix, the end-of-turn drain was two SEPARATE steps with no
// shared critical section: (1) mailbox.drainOrRelease flips mb.state to
// mbIdle under mb.mu and returns, then (2) — only much later, after
// runTurn's own deferred wg.Wait() (title generation) and the rest of the
// call stack unwound back up into Run() — Run's own `defer lk.Release()`
// finally released the OS-level session.SessionLock. Any same-process
// observer of IsSessionBusy(sessionID) (a plain `mb.state != mbIdle` read
// under mb.mu) could see "not busy" strictly BEFORE step 2 ran, legitimately
// try to become the new owner, and hit a spurious SessionLockBusyError from
// its OWN PROCESS's prior, not-yet-unwound turn — silently dropping the
// message (tryReserveSession's owner-branch does not requeue on that error).
//
// This test proves the fix removes that two-step shape entirely by
// reconstructing BOTH shapes against the exact same real OS-level
// session.SessionLock and observing the difference directly:
//
//   - "old shape": call mb.drainOrRelease(epoch) (the mailbox-only primitive,
//     still present for direct unit testing) and, WITHOUT holding mb.mu,
//     probe the real OS lock before calling lk.Release() separately/later —
//     proving the old two-step API allows exactly the observable gap the
//     bug report describes: state already idle, lock still held.
//   - "new shape": call mb.drainOrReleaseFinal(epoch, ...) with the SAME
//     lk.Release as its release callback — proving that by the time it
//     returns hasNext=false, the OS lock is unconditionally already free,
//     because release() runs inside the same mb.mu critical section that
//     flips the state, with no separate later step for a same-process
//     caller to race against.

// TestMailbox_DrainOrReleaseFinal_MuNotHeldDuringRelease_ButNoPrematureIdle

// (TestMailbox_DrainOrReleaseFinal_MuHeldForWholeOfReleaseCallback, which
// asserted the OPPOSITE of the current contract and has been deleted), then
// corrected again per the #297 review: an earlier version of this test
// asserted that work landing during the release() window is handed BACK to
// the original turn loop (state == mbOwned). That is wrong — release() has
// already run by the time the racing submit() is noticed, so the OS lock is
// gone; handing the turn loop another turn to run would mean it runs
// unprotected by any inter-process lock, letting a second process acquire
// the same session lock concurrently. The corrected contract: such work is
// drained into `orphaned` and the era still ends at mbIdle. See
// TestMailbox_DrainOrReleaseFinal_OrphanedWorkNeverRunsWithoutFreshOSLock
// below for the end-to-end proof that a second lock acquisition succeeds
// the instant this call returns.
//
// Before #296, mb.mu was held for the whole of release()'s disk I/O
// (Truncate/Seek/Sync/sidecar-unlink/unlock/Close — no context, no timeout),
// so a slow/hung filesystem, antivirus, or SMB share blocked every other
// in-process reader of the mailbox (submit, Cancel, InterruptAndReplace,
// IsSessionBusy, IsBusy, CancelAll) for that session, unboundedly. #296
// removes that coupling: release() now runs with mb.mu dropped, and
// mb.state == mbReleasing stands in for the mutex as far as HIGH-1's
// atomicity goes.
//
// This test proves the full contract against the exact same paused-release
// setup the old test used:
//  1. mb.mu is NOT held while release() runs — a concurrent submit()
//     completes promptly instead of blocking for the duration of release().
//  2. HIGH-1 still holds — that prompt submit() does NOT become the new
//     owner (mbReleasing reads as busy), and a same-process busy-read
//     observes busy for the whole window.
//  3. The work that landed during the window is neither lost NOR handed
//     back to the (now lock-less) turn loop: it comes back as `orphaned`,
//     and the era ends at mbIdle.
