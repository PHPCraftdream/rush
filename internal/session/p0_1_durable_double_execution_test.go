// P0-1 regression test (docs/reviews/2026-08-11-release-readiness-concurrency-and-code-review.md):
// durable call that hits a busy session mailbox executes exactly once, not twice.
//
// The bug: before the fix, when a durable call (FromDurableQueue=true) encountered
// a busy mailbox (mbOwned or mbReleasing), mailbox.submit would append it to
// mb.submitted AND the pump would nack it with no penalty, so the live owner would
// execute the mb.submitted copy and the pump would re-lease and execute the same
// durable row after backoff — double-execution of the same logical request.
//
// The fix: mailbox.submit now skips mb.submitted for durable calls when the mailbox
// is busy; the durable row itself is the retry path via pump's ErrCallQueuedNotExecuted
// handling, so no in-process handoff is needed.

// TestReleaseGate_P0_1_DurableCallExecutesExactlyOnce proves that the pump's
// existing no-penalty-Nack-and-backoff mechanism (RunQueuePump.executeEntry's
// ErrCallQueuedNotExecuted handling) eventually executes a durable call
// exactly once and Acks it, across multiple backoff cycles.
//
// IMPORTANT SCOPE NOTE (added after independent verification): this test
// uses a mocked Coordinator (durableCallExecutionCounter) that simulates
// "session busy" by directly returning session.ErrCallQueuedNotExecuted —
// it never calls the real sessionAgent.Run / mailbox.submit, so it does
// NOT exercise the actual P0-1 fix (the `if !call.FromDurableQueue` guard
// in internal/agent/mailbox.go's submit). Verified by hand: this test
// still PASSES even with that guard removed (reverted to the pre-fix,
// unconditional `mb.submitted = append(...)`), because this test's fake
// coordinator has no mailbox to double-queue into in the first place. The
// original "REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE" comment here claimed otherwise — that
// claim was false and has been removed.
//
// The REAL regression coverage for the mailbox-level fix lives in
// internal/agent/mailbox_test.go:
// TestMailbox_Submit_DurableCallSkipsQueueWhenAlreadyOwned (and its sibling
// TestMailbox_Submit_NonDurableCallStillQueuesWhenAlreadyOwned, proving
// non-durable calls are unaffected) — both revert-checked directly against
// mailbox.submit.
//
// This test is still kept as a valid, narrower regression: it proves the
// pump-level retry/backoff/eventual-Ack mechanism itself works end-to-end
// (this behavior already existed before P0-1 and is a prerequisite for the
// mailbox-level fix to be sufficient — if the pump ever stopped retrying,
// the mailbox fix alone would leave durable calls permanently stuck instead
// of merely deferring their single execution).
