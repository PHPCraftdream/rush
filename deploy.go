//go:build ignore

// deploy.go — one-shot: prod-build the binary, then replace whatever
// `crush` resolves to on PATH with the freshly built artifact, WITHOUT
// killing any running crush process. Verifies by running the new
// binary's --version.
//
// Live sessions are safe by construction, not by avoidance:
//   Unix:    replaceFile does a temp-write + rename over dst. A running
//            process keeps its open file descriptor pointing at the old
//            inode's data even after the directory entry is replaced, so
//            in-flight `crush` processes are completely unaffected.
//   Windows: renaming a file out from under a running .exe is allowed
//            (the OS only cares about the open data, not the name), but
//            DELETING that renamed-aside file while the process still
//            holds it open is not — it fails with "Access is denied."
//            So replaceFile renames dst aside to "dst.old-<token>"
//            instead of deleting it, then writes the new binary under
//            the now-free dst. The old file lingers under its new name
//            until every process still running it exits, at which point
//            a LATER deploy's cleanup sweep (SweepRenameAsideLeftovers)
//            can finally remove it — failures during that sweep are
//            silently ignored, since "still busy" just means a live
//            session is still serving that build.
//            (Confirmed by hand on 2026-07-29, see
//            docs/plans/2026-07-29-relaunch-from-cache.md §2.)
//
// If NO crush exists on PATH yet, this is a first install: the binary
// goes to the standard per-user location for the OS and the directory
// is made reachable from the command line —
//   Windows:      %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\crush\crush.exe
//                 (dir appended to the user PATH via the registry;
//                 new terminals pick it up, current ones need restart)
//   Linux/macOS:  ~/.local/bin/crush
//                 (already on PATH in most distros; if not, a ready
//                 export line is printed — shell rc files are never
//                 edited automatically)
//
// Usage:   go run deploy.go
// Override the destination path with CRUSH_DEPLOY_PATH=...
//
// The decision logic behind path/PATH handling (install location,
// PATH-membership checks, executable-vs-shim detection, cwd-excluding
// PATH lookup) as well as the rename-aside naming and leftover-sweep
// logic lives in internal/deploy so it is unit-tested by `go test ./...`
// on every OS in CI, even though this file itself is go:build ignore and
// only ever runs via `go run`.
