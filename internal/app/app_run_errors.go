// sqliteConstraintCode is SQLite's primary result code for ANY constraint
// violation (SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, https://sqlite.org/rescode.html) -- the
// low 8 bits of the driver's reported code regardless of which more
// specific extended code (UNIQUE, PRIMARYKEY, NOTNULL, ...) it actually
// carries. Named so isSessionsIDConstraintError's masking logic below reads
// as intent rather than a bare magic number -- mirrors
// isPermanentOrphanOutboxDrainError's identical `Code() & 0xff == 19` check
// in internal/session/run_queue_orphan_drain.go, which documents (having
// verified it against this project's actual observed driver behavior) that
// modernc.org/sqlite reports the EXTENDED code by default, so masking with
// 0xff is what recovers the primary code this comparison needs.
const sqliteConstraintCode = 19

// isSessionsIDConstraintError reports whether err is a SQLite PRIMARY
// KEY/UNIQUE constraint violation on sessions.id specifically — the shape
// produced when two `crush run --session <id>` processes race the very
// first INSERT for an id that has never existed before (task #605).
//
// Two layers, in order:
//
//  1. Typed fast path: modernc.org/sqlite's *sqlite.Error exposes a
//     numeric Code() (see isPermanentOrphanOutboxDrainError in
//     internal/session/run_queue_orphan_drain.go for the same &0xff
//     masking, applied there against this exact codebase's confirmed
//     driver behavior). A match narrows this to "some constraint was
//     violated", not specifically sessions.id — SQLite's code alone does
//     not carry the offending table/column, only sqlite3_errmsg's text
//     does — so the substring check below still runs to confirm the
//     column identity even when the typed check matches.
//  2. Textual fallback: err's message chain must contain "constraint
//     failed" (used verbatim by both drivers this project can be built
//     with — see modernc.org/sqlite's error.go ErrorCodeString table and
//     github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3's internal/sqlite3_wrap.ErrorCodeString,
//     both confirmed by reading the vendored driver source at the versions
//     pinned in go.mod, v1.50.1 and v0.34.2 respectively) AND
//     "sessions.id". This is the ONLY layer active when the typed check
//     above cannot run (github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3, the fallback driver
//     on platforms connect_ncruces.go's build tag selects, is not
//     type-asserted here to avoid a second build-tag-gated copy of this
//     function; its errors fall straight through to this textual layer)
//     and is what actually identifies WHICH column/table was violated on
//     every path.
//
// A previous version of this comment additionally claimed the driver could
// render this as "constraint violation" (not "failed"). That phrase does
// not appear ANYWHERE in either driver's own error-text-producing code
// (confirmed by reading both drivers' vendored source: modernc's
// error.go/conn.go always use SQLite's own sqlite3_errstr wording, which is
// "constraint failed", never "constraint violation"; ncruces's
// internal/sqlite3_wrap.ErrorCodeString hard-codes "sqlite3: constraint
// failed" for the same code) — it was never observed, only assumed, and is
// removed rather than carried forward unverified.
//
// Deliberately narrow: only sessions.id, and only a constraint failure.
// This must NOT match every database error — a genuinely broken DB (disk
// full, corruption, permission denied, a constraint violation on some
// OTHER table/column) has to keep surfacing as-is so the operator sees a
// real failure instead of a swallowed one. See resolveSession's caller for
// why this matters: an earlier pass in this project quarantined entries on
// ANY error instead of a proven-permanent one, which is exactly the
// category of bug this narrow match exists to avoid repeating -- and see
// TestResolveSession_CreationRace_OtherConstraintNotSwallowed /
// TestIsSessionsIDConstraintError_MessagesIDNotMatched for the regression
// coverage proving a constraint violation on a DIFFERENT column (e.g.
// messages.id) is never swallowed by either layer.
