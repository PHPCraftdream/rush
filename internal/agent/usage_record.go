// providerCacheSupport classifies whether a provider actually reports prompt
// caching, so a stored zero can be told apart from "we were never told".
//
// Everything currently reachable does report it, each verified against the
// mapping code or the live CLI:
//
//   - local-cli — claude/codex/gemini/qwen all emit cache counters; see
//     internal/agent/cliprovider/usage.go for the captured wire samples.
//   - openai-compatible (zai, openrouter, vercel) — fantasy fills
//     CacheReadTokens from prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens
//     (providers/openai/language_model_hooks.go:225).
//   - anthropic — CacheCreationTokens/CacheReadTokens from the API's own
//     fields (providers/anthropic/anthropic.go:1318).
//   - google — CacheReadTokens from CachedContentTokenCount
//     (providers/google/google.go:1465).
//
// The function still exists, rather than hardcoding "native", because a
// provider that silently stops reporting would otherwise be indistinguishable
// from a perfect cache miss streak. When a new provider type appears here that
// has NOT been checked, classify it as none and let the UI say "n/a" — an
// honest gap beats a fabricated 0%.
