// goroutine. A later review found that went too far — it also deferred
// runtime.Stack's capture itself, so a turn that unwound quickly after
// cancel() could race the async goroutine and dump post-cancellation state
// instead of the actual hang, or (if the process exited first) never dump
// at all.

// is the synchronous, I/O-free half: it must return a populated buffer
