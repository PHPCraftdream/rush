// Fork patch: task #223 — split out of a single `toolTimeout bool` that
// could only distinguish "a tool ran too long" from "everything else". That
// left a genuine --timeout-hard-cap fire (whether or not a tool happened to
// be in flight) indistinguishable from a real provider idle-stall: both
// passed toolTimeout=false, so agent.go's onFire callback always reported
// "Stream stalled" — blaming the provider for silence even when the
// provider was fine and the turn simply hit its own configured wall-clock
// ceiling. See CHANGELOG.md for the two-step history: 77c1104a fixed the
// boolean misclassification (hard-cap-with-tool-in-flight no longer claimed
// toolTimeout=true), and this type finishes the job by giving the hard-cap
// case its own identity so the finish message can name the real cause.

	// There used to be a separate, larger cap just for delegations, but

	// inside its turn) hit the shorter plain cap just as often as a parent
	// waiting on a delegation hit the old short cap. One generous cap for

	// It exists for the window between "the turn's real work is finished"
	// and "genCtx is cancelled" -- runTurn spends up to titleJoinGrace there
	// waiting for a title, with no bump() calls, and the hard cap is
	// absolute from turn start rather than idle-based, so a turn that
	// finished just inside --timeout-hard-cap could be pushed over it by
	// that wait alone. The result was a stall dump and a warning about a
	// turn that had already succeeded, and the cancel killed the very title
	// being waited for.
	//
	// Idempotent, and safe to never call: the goroutine still exits on ctx,
	// and <-done still works. Disarming does NOT mean the turn is
	// unprotected -- by the time it is called, there is nothing left to
	// protect except a bounded wait.

}

// startStreamWatchdog launches a goroutine that calls cancel() if bump() is
// not invoked for idleTimeout. The goroutine exits when ctx is cancelled
// (either by the caller or by the watchdog itself) and closes done.
//
// onFire, if non-nil, is invoked AFTER stalled is set to true and BEFORE
// cancel() — typically used to emit a slog.Warn with diagnostic context the
// watchdog itself does not have (session ID, model, provider, etc.). The
// watchdogCause identifies which of the three fire conditions triggered:
// causeToolTimeout when a tool exceeded toolMaxDuration (the never-freeze
// backstop), causeHardCap when the turn hit --timeout-hard-cap (regardless
// of whether a tool happened to be in flight at the time), or causeIdleStall
// when the provider genuinely stopped sending data for idleTimeout with no
// tool in flight.
//
// INVARIANT (task #227 + #232): every fire site below calls onFire strictly
// BEFORE cancel(), never after — so onFire sits directly on the critical
// path to cancellation. onFire MUST NOT block for an unbounded time: cancel()
// does not run until onFire returns, so a slow or hung onFire (e.g. a
// diagnostic write to a stuck disk/network mount) delays or — if truly
// unbounded — permanently prevents ctx from ever being cancelled, which in
// turn means callers blocked on <-wd.done (the documented contract just
// above) never unblock either. Any work inside onFire that is not itself
// bounded (a fixed timeout, or dispatched async and not awaited) must not be
// placed here.
//
// Fork patch: batch 8 — extendsOnProgress + hardCap parameters.
// When extendsOnProgress is true, every bump() also extends the effective
// deadline to max(absoluteDeadline, now+idleTimeout), capped at hardCap
// from the start time. This prevents killing healthy long compositions
// while still bounding the worst case.
//
// Fork patch: never-freeze backstop — toolMaxDuration bounds the tool
// pause. Past it the watchdog fires with cause=causeToolTimeout so the turn
// ends instead of hanging forever on a stuck tool. One cap applies to
// every tool in flight, sub-agent delegations included — see toolStarted's
// doc on the streamWatchdog struct for why a single generous cap replaced
// the old plain-vs-exempt split.
//
// Fork patch: parent/child cancellation race — toolCleanupGrace adds a
// fixed, tool-agnostic buffer ON TOP of toolMaxDuration before this
// watchdog is allowed to fire on the tool-pause path. It exists because a
// tool call that is itself an `agent`-tool delegation runs a full nested
// Run()/runTurn() with its OWN stream watchdog, started only once the
// delegation actually begins executing (after init, DB preamble, etc.) —
// strictly LATER than this (the parent's) watchdog started counting from
// OnToolCall. Both watchdogs are configured with the same toolMaxDuration
// (see toolExecutionMaxDefault's doc for why a two-tier, tool-name-keyed
// cap was rejected), so without a grace period the parent's clock, having
// a head start, always reaches the cap first and cancels genCtx — which
// cascades into the child's ctx — before the child's OWN watchdog ever
// gets to fire on ITS cap and let the child unwind cleanly (write its
// finish part, transfer cost to the parent session per task #197, dump
// goroutines for diagnostics). toolCleanupGrace is added uniformly to
// EVERY tool-in-flight, not selected by tool name/kind — it is a
// structural allowance for "this watchdog is the OUTER one waiting on a
// tool that may itself be watchdog-protected and need to unwind," not a
// special case for the `agent` tool specifically. A plain (non-delegating)
// tool that runs past toolMaxDuration+toolCleanupGrace is still caught,
// just toolCleanupGrace later than before.
//
// Fork patch: task #222, superseded by task #300 — recordActivity, if
// non-nil, is invoked on every bump() (harmless duplication with the
// caller's own notify, see bump's doc). It is deliberately NOT invoked on
// a timer while a tool is merely in flight (see the toolsInFlight branch
// below): task #222 originally did that, on the theory that a long
// synchronous tool call (e.g. a 45-minute sub-agent delegation) produces
// no stream callbacks and would otherwise starve SessionLock's
// activity-gated heartbeat (RecordActivity/task #214) for the tool's
// whole duration. The cost was that the heartbeat then reported "alive"
// purely because a tool call was OPEN, making a genuinely wedged tool
// indistinguishable from a working one for its entire cap — observed live
// as a session with a fresh heartbeat for 38 minutes while its sub-agent
// sat stuck on a trivial command. Task #300 removed the timer-driven call:
// #222's original concern is covered without it, because
// withActivityNotify (agent.go) composes each session's activity callback
// with its ancestors', so a delegated sub-agent's REAL stream callbacks
// still walk back up and touch every ancestor's lock. A non-delegating
// tool that emits nothing for a long time now goes heartbeat-quiet, which
// is the honest signal. See the toolsInFlight branch below for where this
// is enforced, and TestStreamWatchdog_NoTimerDrivenActivityWhileToolInFlight
// for the regression coverage.
