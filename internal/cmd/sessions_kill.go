var sessionsKillCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "kill <id>",
	Short: "Kill the process holding a session's lock and remove the lock file",
	Long: `Force-release a session that is stuck behind a live or orphan
crush process. Reads the holder PID from .crush/locks/session-<id>.lock,
forcibly kills it (SIGKILL on POSIX, taskkill /F /T on Windows so the
whole subprocess tree dies), waits for the OS to release the file
handle, then removes the lock file.

Use this when:
- A "crush run --session <id>" reports "session is already in use", but
  you know the real holder is dead (or stuck) and won't release.
- "crush sessions reset --force" cannot proceed because the lock survived.
- A previous run was force-killed (TaskStop / Ctrl+C on a wrapper) and
  left the child crush process orphaned, still holding the lock.

On Windows the kill goes through ` + "`taskkill /F /T /PID`" + ` which
also terminates every child the crush process spawned (typically the
external CLI: claude.cmd → node.exe). The plain os.Process.Kill() goes
through OpenProcess(PROCESS_TERMINATE), which can fail with "Access is
denied" for processes launched under Git Bash or MSYS — taskkill avoids
that whole class of issue.

On Unix (Linux/macOS) a CLI-provider child (the ` + "`claude`" + `/` + "`gemini`" + `/` + "`codex`" + `/` + "`qwen`" + ` process crush
launched) is spawned as the leader of its OWN process group, deliberately
separate from crush's, so an ordinary signal to crush does not also kill
it (see internal/session/track_unix.go). Because of that, SIGKILL to the
crush PID by itself does NOT reach that child tree on Unix.

This command closes that gap, but ONLY when it can prove the process
group it is about to signal is still the one that was actually spawned
for THIS session's CURRENT lock holder. When crush registers a
CLI-provider child group (automatic for every model run through the ` + "`cli`" + `
provider), the registration is written next to the session's own lock
file, under its per-user ` + "`.crush/locks`" + ` directory (see
internal/session/childgroup_registry_unix.go) -- NOT a shared, predictable
path -- and it is stamped with the exact lock generation token that was
current at registration time (the same generation mechanism
internal/session/lock.go already uses to guard its own destructive
cleanup). Once the crush PID itself is confirmed dead, this command:

  1. re-reads the CURRENT generation for this session's lock and discards
     any registered group whose recorded generation does not match
     EXACTLY -- this is what makes the registry safe to trust across a
     crashed crush process, a reused PID, or a different crush instance
     having since taken over the same session id;
  2. re-verifies each remaining candidate is still a live process-group
     leader (and, on Linux, that its process start time still matches
     what was recorded) immediately before signalling it; only then
  3. killpg's what is left.

The report tells you which of three things happened, because they must
not be read as the same outcome:

  - "swept N registered ... group(s)": reached and killed.
  - "... generation no longer matches the current lock ... NOT reached":
    a registration existed but could not be trusted for THIS kill (crush
    process predates this feature, restarted, or a different owner has
    since held the session) -- the child tree may still be running.
  - "... no longer look like the process that registered them ... NOT
    reached": the generation matched but the process group itself no
    longer looks plausible (already exited, or the number was recycled).

If none of those lines appear at all, no registration was ever found for
this session, which most commonly means the CLI-provider child either
never started or was never tracked. In every "NOT reached" case above, you
would need to find and kill the child tree separately (e.g. ` + "`pkill -f claude`" + `).
This whole paragraph does not apply on Windows, where ` + "`taskkill /F /T`" + ` plus
the Job Object tracking described above already reaches the full tree
unconditionally.

The lock FILE is only removed once the holder is PROVEN dead (either the
OS lock was acquirable — nobody holds it — or the kill was issued and the
PID was observed to exit) AND a fresh OS-lock probe still succeeds right
before the unlink. If the kill fails, the PID is still alive after the
wait, or the lock state is unknown, the file is LEFT IN PLACE — an empty
lock file with no held OS lock is harmless (the next acquirer simply
reopens and overwrites it; see internal/session/lock.go), and removing a
path out from under a live OS lock is exactly the two-owners bug this
command must never trigger. Pass --keep-lock to skip the file removal
entirely even on a confirmed kill.`,
	Example: `
crush sessions kill pr-42
crush sessions kill pr-42 --keep-lock     # just kill, leave the lock file
crush sessions kill pr-42 --wait 10s      # wait up to 10s for the PID to die

//
// Why: the lock file's PID is metadata, not proof. A holder that exited
// cleanly runs Release(), which clears that metadata (see
// session.SessionLock.Release), but an OLD lock file predating that fix, or
// one whose Release() never ran (process crashed and the file was left
// mid-write, or something wrote the file directly, as tests sometimes do)
// can still carry a stale PID. If the OS has since recycled that PID number
// for a totally unrelated process — routine on a busy CI/dev box — blindly
// kill(pid)-ing it would take out an innocent process.
//
// The only authoritative signal for "is anyone actually still holding this
// lock" is attempting to take the real OS lock ourselves:
//   - If TryAcquireSessionLock SUCCEEDS, nobody holds the lock right now,
//     full stop (see the package doc on SessionLock) — the recorded PID, if
//     any, is stale/dead/reused. We must NOT touch that PID. Release our
//     probe lock immediately and report ConfirmedDead (the holder is gone).
//   - If it reports *session.SessionLockBusyError, someone genuinely holds
//     the OS lock right now — the classic case this command exists for —
//     proceed to forceKillHolder exactly as before.
//   - Any OTHER error (permission denied, IO error, etc.) is NOT proof of
//     either state. FAIL CLOSED: return holderProbeError with
//     ConfirmedDead=false and do NOT kill the recorded PID. The previous
//     behavior fell back to unconditionally killing whatever PID was
//     recorded on any unidentified probe failure — exactly the stale/reused
//     PID danger the busy/acquire branches exist to avoid, just reached via a
//     different path. An unrelated IO hiccup must not turn this command into
//     "kill an arbitrary PID number off disk".
//
// What this does NOT solve: a residual PID-reuse TOCTOU window between "probe
// proved contention" and "the PID is actually killed". The busy-error branch
// proves someone holds the lock at the moment TryAcquireSessionLock ran, but
// forceKillHolder then makes its own separate IsProcessAlive + KillProcess
// syscalls at a later moment. In principle the OS could recycle that exact PID
// for an unrelated process in the gap. Closing this fully would require
// retaining an OS-level handle to the process at probe time and killing
// through that handle (Windows HANDLE could; POSIX needs pidfd). Given this is
// a manual rescue tool an operator runs deliberately, that structural fix is
// not implemented; the window is accepted as a narrow, known limitation.
