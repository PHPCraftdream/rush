//  2. Unlock the OS-level lock (unlockFile) - this is the critical correctness-critical step.
//  3. Close the file descriptor (f.Close).
//  4. Clear diagnostic metadata (clearHolderMetadata) - best-effort cleanup that can hang.
//     IMPORTANT: This now runs in a BACKGROUND goroutine. The function returns
//     immediately after unlock/close, ensuring that callers (mailbox state machine)
//     are not blocked by potentially-infinite filesystem I/O.
//
// The old order (clear metadata BEFORE unlock/close) meant that a hung filesystem,
// AV scan, or SMB share during clearHolderMetadata (Truncate/Seek/Sync/Remove) would
// prevent the OS lock from ever being released, wedging the session forever.
//
// Even after the P1-2 reordering (unlock/close first, THEN cleanup), Release() still
// waited synchronously for cleanup to complete before returning. This meant that
// if cleanup hung, the mailbox state machine would be stuck in mbReleasing state
// forever - no new owner could take over, even though the OS lock was already free.
//
// The new order prioritizes releasing the OS lock AND closing the file descriptor AND
// returning control to the caller BEFORE any diagnostic cleanup that can hang. If
// clearHolderMetadata hangs in the background, the OS lock is already gone, the file
// descriptor is already closed, and the mailbox has already transitioned to mbIdle -
// no session wedged state, no resource leak. The only downside is that clearHolderMetadata
// must now operate on a closed file, so we pass only the path (not the open file handle)
// and let it reopen the file just for the metadata operations.
//
// Before actually unlocking, it wipes the PID it stamped into both the
// primary lock file and the sidecar (see clearHolderMetadata). This
// matters for `crush sessions kill`: without it, a process that exits
// cleanly (Release() runs, e.g. via a normal `defer`) leaves its old PID
// sitting in the lock file/sidecar on disk. If the OS later reuses that
// PID number for a completely unrelated process — routine on a busy
// CI/dev box — a later `sessions kill <id>` invocation would read a
// "plausible" PID from the stale file and forcibly kill that unrelated
// process. The lock FILE itself is deliberately left in place — see
// acquireSessionLockFile and the package doc for why unlinking the path
// is unsafe/unnecessary; only its content is cleared.
//
// Data race safety: The background goroutine captures `path` by value, so there's

//
// Takes expectedGeneration for this holder's acquire instance; cleanup
// is skipped if the current generation on disk does not match (indicating

// goroutine from clobbering a new owner's metadata.
//
// P1-2 fix (2026-08-09): Now takes only the path (not an open file *os.File)
// because Release() now closes the file before calling this. This function
// reopens the file just for the metadata operations, ensuring that if it
// hangs, the original file descriptor is already closed and the OS lock
// is already released.
//
// WARNING: This function performs file I/O operations (open/Truncate/Seek/Sync
// on the lock file and Remove on the sidecars) that can hang indefinitely
// on slow/unavailable filesystems, AV scans, or SMB shares. For this reason,
// Release() calls this AFTER unlocking the OS lock and closing the file.
// This means clearHolderMetadata runs WITHOUT holding the OS lock, so:
//   - A hang here does NOT prevent other processes from acquiring the lock.
//   - If it hangs, no file descriptor leaks (the original fd is already closed).
//   - Another process may briefly see stale metadata in the tiny window
//     between our unlock and our successful clear, but the OS lock is the
//     source of truth for ownership.
//
// Best-effort: any failure here only degrades diagnosability (same
// posture as writePIDSidecar) and must never block Release from
// actually unlocking/closing the file — a stuck holder that can't be
// released would be strictly worse than a stale PID left on disk.
//
// P0 fix (2026-08-09): a "reacquire and check before truncating" guard
// (attempt a non-blocking tryLockFile; skip cleanup if someone else holds
// it) was tried here to narrow the clobber window described above, and
// reverted. Even that minimal check — tryLockFile immediately followed by
// unlockFile, no held duration at all in the common case — was enough,
// under real Go-scheduler contention (many parallel goroutines/tests
// competing for CPU), to occasionally delay the background goroutine's
// syscalls long enough to collide with a caller's own fast re-acquire of
// the SAME session id it just released: internal/agent's retry loops
// (restartOrphanedWithRetry/startDetachedRun, 100-800ms backoff) and
// several of its pre-existing tests (mailbox_lock_test.go,
// run_defer_wedge_test.go, run_legacy_queue_reclaim_test.go,
// run_queue_drain_test.go, compact_lock_test.go) assert that the OS lock
// is reacquirable essentially immediately once Release() returns, with no
// grace period — and under load, this repeatedly reproduced real, not
// flaky-in-isolation, self-collisions where a caller's own next acquire
// attempt observed SessionLockBusyError against ITS OWN prior release's
// background cleanup goroutine, not a genuine external holder. That is a
// worse regression than the narrow clobber window it was meant to close.
//
// So this function is intentionally unconditional with respect to the OS
// lock: it never re-touches the OS lock at all, only the plain file
// operations below. The generation check provides a best-effort
// compare-and-delete guard without the OS-lock reacquire that was
// previously shown to cause false self-contention under load. This
// narrows the clobber window from ~50ms (releaseMetadataCleanupBound) to
// microseconds (the TOCTOU gap between reading the generation sidecar
// and performing the destructive operations) — a best-effort improvement
// for diagnosability, not an absolute guarantee.
//
// ACCEPTED RISK (2026-08-12, docs/reviews/2026-08-12-post-fix-release-readiness-review.md, P2-1):
// The residual microsecond TOCTOU gap here is explicitly accepted as a
// diagnostic-only risk. A new owner could theoretically acquire and write
// its generation between our read and truncate/remove, briefly exposing
// their PID to `sessions kill`/`sessions why`/`sessions locks`. This is
// cosmetic: the OS lock alone is the correctness source of truth, and
// nothing downstream trusts this metadata for a destructive decision
// without independently re-probing the OS lock first (see
// sessions_kill.go's probeThenKillHolder and its lockHolderProvablyDead
// final re-check). Closing this gap architecturally would require
// re-acquiring the OS lock, which has already been tried and reverted
// multiple times (commit ac0536c4, task #337) for causing false
// SessionLockBusyError self-collisions under real scheduler load — a
// worse regression than the narrow diagnostic window. The current
