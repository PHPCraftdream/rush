// window can, under load, actually land after the internal timer already
// fired. That produces exactly the "elapsed < grace but chunk still lost"

// the suite. The exact simultaneous-readiness window this follow-up guards
// against is not deterministically reproducible with the tools available

// created with capacity 1) at the moment the idle-timeout branch is
// entered, drainPendingChunk successfully retrieves it rather than treating
// the channel as empty. Because this calls the exact function
