// TestP0_338_FinalizerReachableDespiteHungCleanup empirically proves that the
// ownership finalizer (abandonOwnershipWithHandoff) in sessionAgent.Run is
// ALWAYS reachable, even if SessionLock.Release() hangs on diagnostic cleanup.
//
// This test proves BOTH reachability AND correct execution:
//  1. Reachability: Run() returns quickly despite hung cleanup, proving Release()
//     defer doesn't block the finalizer from being reached.
//  2. Execution: orphaned call (queued before Run) is actually executed by the
//     finalizer's detached run, proven by provider call count and message history.
//
// The test:
//  1. Injects a blocking version of clearHolderMetadataFn via SessionAgentOptions.LockOptions
//     (using session.WithClearHolderMetadataFn).
//  2. Starts a Run() that acquires the OS lock.
//  3. The first call to the provider returns an error via a custom context,
//     causing Run() to error out quickly and trigger the finalizer.
//  4. Verifies that Run() returns quickly (within 1s, well below the 2s the
//     injected hung cleanup blocks for) even though cleanup is blocked — this
//     proves Release() defer doesn't block.
//  5. Verifies that the cleanup goroutine actually started (proves it was spawned).
//  6. Verifies that the OS lock is available even while cleanup is blocked.
//  7. Verifies that the finalizer abandonOwnershipWithHandoff actually ran
//     and correctly handed off the orphaned call via two proofs:
//     a. Provider was called at least twice (once for firstCall, once for orphanedCall)
//     b. orphanedCall.Prompt appears in the session's message history
//
// Since task #340 ROUND 3, the finalizer's detached run durably enqueues the
// orphaned call instead of executing it inline, so this test also starts a
// session.RunQueuePump (fast TestTick) to prove the queue is actually drained,
// not just written to.
//
// This is the SAME execution proof pattern as p0_2_regression_test.go
// (TestP0_2_RetryExhaustion_QueuesCall), using httptest.Server with SSE responses
// and atomic counters inside the HTTP handler.
//
// NOTE: This test is NOT parallel because it mutates package-local state that
// would create a data race with other parallel tests doing the same.
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE:
//  1. In lock.go Release(), change "go cleanupFn(path)" back to "cleanupFn(path)"
//     (remove the "go " keyword) in the background goroutine launch.
//  2. Run: go test ./internal/agent -run TestP0_338_FinalizerReachableDespiteHungCleanup -v
//  3. The test will FAIL because Run() hangs forever on Release().
//  4. Restore the fix (add "go " back) and the test will PASS.
