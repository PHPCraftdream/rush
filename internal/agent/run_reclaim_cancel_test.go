// TestRun_CancelDuringLegacyReclaimWindow_ActuallyCancelsTurn2 is the
// end-to-end regression test for round 11 review, MEDIUM-1.
//
// Before the fix, drainOrReleaseMerged's legacy-queue reclaim (the same
// mechanism TestRun_LegacyQueueMessageDuringFinalDrain_DoesNotWedgeAcrossTurns
// exercises for HIGH-1 of round 10) called `mb.reclaimSameEra(epoch, nil)` —
// note the literal nil. reclaimSameEra set mb.state back to mbOwned and
// mb.dispatcherCancel to that nil, but never touched mb.current.cancel
// (already nilled out by the preceding drainOrRelease call). So immediately
// after a legacy-queue reclaim, BOTH mailbox cancel handles were nil, and
// stayed nil until turn 2 itself reached its own beginGeneration call in
// Run's loop.
//
// Any sa.Cancel(sessionID) landing in that window found nothing to cancel:
// genCancel := mb.current.cancel (nil); fallback mb.dispatcherCancel (also
// nil) -> `if genCancel != nil` skips the call entirely. A silent no-op —
// Ctrl-C/sessions kill/cost-cap landing in this narrow window would
// silently fail to interrupt the reclaimed turn.
//
// This test proves the fix (drainOrReleaseFinal now stores the reclaim
// cancel into mb.dispatcherCancel, and clears mb.current.cancel, both in
// the SAME critical section as the reclaim decision) by driving a real
// sa.Cancel(sess.ID) call and confirming turn 2 (the reclaimed call) never
// gets a chance to run to completion: its context is cancelled before its
// provider request would otherwise succeed.
//
// It uses TWO test-only seams, in sequence, to make the interleaving
// deterministic rather than racy:
//
//  1. mailbox.testDrainSeam fires inside drainOrReleaseFinal, strictly
//     before the legacy-queue reclaim runs. Released immediately — it only
//     signals "the reclaim is about to happen", so the test can then wait
//     for seam 2 instead of guessing with a sleep.
//  2. mailbox.testLoopRearmSeam fires in Run's turn loop (agent.go),
//     strictly AFTER the reclaim's critical section has already run to
//     completion (dispatcherCancel populated, current.cancel nil'd) and
//     mb.mu released, and strictly BEFORE that same loop iteration calls
//     beginGeneration(turnCancel) to re-arm current.cancel for turn 2. The
//     test parks the loop here, calls sa.Cancel(sess.ID) to completion
//     (guaranteed to observe the reclaim's already-fixed state, since the
//     loop cannot have re-armed yet), and only then releases the loop to
//     proceed with its own beginGeneration call.
//
// Earlier versions of this test used only seam 1 and assumed that was
// enough to "deterministically" land Cancel inside the reclaim window. That
// assumption was checked empirically (temporarily reverting just the
// mb.current.cancel = nil line in mailbox.go's reclaim branch, run
// repeatedly) and found false both before and after #284/#296: once seam 1
// releases and drainOrReleaseFinal's own mb.mu.Unlock() runs, there is a
// genuine, unguarded race for the NEXT mb.mu acquisition between a blocked
// Cancel() goroutine and the loop's own re-arm — regardless of whether the
// re-arm writes the SAME cancel value each iteration (true before #284) or
// a FRESH, distinct one every iteration (true after #284's turnCtx/
// turnCancel split). Either way the race existed; only the shape of what
// "losing" it looked like changed. Seam 2 removes the race by parking the
// loop before it can even attempt the re-arm.
//
// TestMailbox_DrainOrReleaseFinal_LegacyReclaimNeverReleasesLock
// (mailbox_lock_test.go) is, and remains, the authoritative regression
// guard for the underlying MEDIUM-1 defect: it asserts the exact same
// post-reclaim state directly, in the same goroutine, with no concurrency
// at all. This test is the additional real-Run()/real-Cancel() integration
// check — with seam 2 it is now deterministic too, not merely
// non-false-failing.
