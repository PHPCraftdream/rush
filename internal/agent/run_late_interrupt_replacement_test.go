// TestRun_LateInterruptReplacement_SurvivesNormalCompletion_P0A is the
// end-to-end regression test for release-blocker P0-A (task #292, fixed by
// commit db546653).
//
// The bug: interruptAndReplace records the payload in mb.replacement and
// returns a cancel func for the caller to invoke outside the mailbox lock.
// If that cancel loses the race against agent.Stream's own normal
// completion — Stream returns nil, NOT context.Canceled, because the
// provider had already finished sending its last chunk by the time the
// cancel actually propagated — runTurn takes the normal-completion path
// instead of the isCancelErr branch. Only isCancelErr's branch called
// drainAfterCancel, which is the ONLY place that used to look at
// mb.replacement; the normal-completion path went straight to
// drainOrReleaseMerged/drainOrReleaseFinal, which (pre-fix) checked only
// mb.submitted and the legacy queue — never mb.replacement. The replacement
// was silently stranded: Run's own defer could only push it to the legacy
// queue (no runner) or no-op it under a new era.
//
// This test reproduces the exact race deterministically instead of relying
// on OS/network-level timing (calling the real cancel func and hoping the
// SSE response wins the race would make the test flaky in either direction
// — cancelling genCtx normally DOES propagate to the in-flight HTTP request
// and usually surfaces as context.Canceled, which is the common case this
// bug does NOT cover). Instead it drives the REAL production
// interruptAndReplace method directly (the same technique
// run_orphaned_release_race_test.go's full-path test uses for the
// analogous release-window race) to land mb.replacement, WITHOUT invoking
// the cancel func it returns — standing in for "the cancel lost the race
// and never actually stopped Stream in time". The ORIGINAL turn's stream is
// then allowed to complete normally by closing `proceed`, so runTurn's err
// is nil and the normal-completion path (not isCancelErr's drainAfterCancel)
// is what must recover the replacement. That is precisely the scenario
// drainOrReleaseFinal's own doc describes: "a late interrupt whose cancel
// lost the race to Stream's normal completion".
//
// Verified by revert: reverting db546653's replacement branch in
// drainOrReleaseFinal makes this test fail with exactly 1 provider call (the
// original turn only) and the replacement prompt absent from history — see
// the task report for the captured failure output.
