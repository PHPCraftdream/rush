// The canonical token-accounting convention, enforced here and nowhere else.
//
// fantasy.Usage.InputTokens counts ONLY tokens billed as fresh input. Tokens
// served from the provider's prompt cache live in CacheReadTokens; tokens
// written INTO the cache live in CacheCreationTokens. The three are disjoint,
// so the full prompt size is their sum. Downstream code relies on this:
//
//	internal/agent/agent_usage.go:88  PromptTokens = InputTokens + CacheReadTokens + CacheCreationTokens
//	internal/agent/agent_usage.go:45-48  cost = in*InputTokens + inCached*CacheCreation
//	                                       + outCached*CacheRead + out*OutputTokens
//
// The CLIs do NOT agree on this. Measured 2026-08-16 by running each binary
// repeatedly against a fixed prompt and watching which counter moved:
//
//   - claude 2.1.197 — EXCLUSIVE. input_tokens held at 10 across three runs
//     while cache_creation/cache_read shifted (6203+17298 -> 0+23501). The
//     prompt total is input + cache_creation + cache_read.
//
//   - codex 0.147.0 — INCLUSIVE. input_tokens held at 16856 across three runs
//     while cached_input_tokens moved (6912 -> 5888). Had it been exclusive it
//     would have risen when the cache share fell. input_tokens IS the total,
//     exactly like OpenAI's prompt_tokens.
//
//   - gemini 0.55.1 — INCLUSIVE, and self-evidencing: it emits both
//     input_tokens (12601) and a separate exclusive input (4453) alongside
//     cached (8148), and 4453+8148 == 12601.
//
// Mixing those conventions in one field is what rawUsage exists to prevent.

// rawUsage is a CLI's own numbers, in that CLI's own convention. Parsers fill
// it verbatim from the wire and let normalize() do the arithmetic, so the
// inclusive->exclusive subtraction lives in exactly one place.
