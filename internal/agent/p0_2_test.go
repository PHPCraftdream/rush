// TestCheckpointGenerationOverlap is the P0-2 Part B regression test for the
// checkpointGeneration data race. This test creates TWO GENUINELY OVERLAPPING
// checkpoint generations through REAL runTurn closures (not a hand-copied
// model), driven through the real interruptAndReplace path, and asserts the
// overlap completes without hanging, panicking, or corrupting state.
//
// The test builds the overlap scenario using the same technique as
// TestP0_4_StopCheckpointCancelsBlockedWrite:
//  1. Start generation 1 with a pausing SSE model (blocks after first content)
//  2. Block generation 1's checkpoint write via a message.Service wrapper
//  3. While blocked, interrupt-and-replace to start generation 2
//  4. Generation 2 calls startCheckpoint() BEFORE generation 1's
//     stopCheckpoint() fully completes → overlap on checkpointGeneration
//
// HONEST LIMITATION (found during the orchestrator's own verification, not
// assumed from the delegate's report): this test's overlap mechanism uses
// channels (gen1CheckpointBlockChan/blockSignal) to coordinate the two
// generations. Channel operations are themselves synchronization points the
// Go race detector respects, so they incidentally impose a happens-before
// edge around the very moment checkpointGeneration is touched — the manual
// revert-check below (mutex removed from agent.go, same command run
// -count=10) came back CLEAN, not failing, both when this was tried by the
// delegate and independently re-verified by the orchestrator. This test
// does NOT prove the specific data race the fix addresses; it proves the
// overlap scenario itself is race-detector-clean AND behaviorally correct
// (no hang, no panic, no lost checkpoint) under the current (fixed) code.
// The mutex fix's correctness rests on code-level mutual-exclusion
// reasoning (every access to checkpointGeneration is now under
// checkpointMu, full stop), not on this test catching a live race.
//
// Run with: CRUSH_GLOBAL_DATA=$(mktemp -d) CRUSH_GLOBAL_CONFIG=$(mktemp -d) go test ./internal/agent -race -run TestCheckpointGenerationOverlap -count=5

// checkpointPartsLen. The latter created its own context.WithTimeout(30s)

// context package rather than startCheckpoint — it could not fail for any
// state of the repo. The real property both claimed to cover (no

// scenario.
