//
// A single, stable, well-known path is used — not a per-destination
// sidecar (e.g. dst+".deploy.lock") — because resolveDests's discovered
// destinations can legitimately differ between two invocations of
// deploy.go: the npm-shim directory depends on wherever `crush` resolves
// on THIS invocation's PATH, CRUSH_DEPLOY_PATH can be set for one run and
// not another, and a first-install run has no pre-existing dst at all
// (DefaultInstallPath is used instead). A per-dst lock would only
// serialize two deploys that happen to resolve to the exact same dst set
// in the exact same order — the scenario this guards against (two
// deploys interleaving across DIFFERENT destinations, e.g. deploy A
// replaces the npm-shim while deploy B is mid-replacing the node_modules
// binary) would slip right past it. A single global lock instead
// serializes step 4 (replace-all-destinations) end-to-end across ANY two
// concurrent deploys on the same machine, regardless of what they each
// resolve dsts to — the correctness property the review actually asked
// for ("two deploys must never interleave their dst replacements").
// os.TempDir() is used rather than colocating with a dst because there
// may be zero destinations that exist yet (first install) and because
// the lock must be discoverable before resolveDests has even run.

// AcquireDeployLock takes an exclusive, cross-process lock guarding
// deploy.go's step 4 (replace every resolved destination) and step 5
// (post-replace --version verification), so two `go run deploy.go`
// invocations racing on the same machine can never interleave their
// per-destination renames.
//
// Without this lock, two concurrent deploys replacing the SAME set of
// destinations (typical: an npm-shim sibling + the node_modules real
// binary, kept in sync — see resolveDests) could each replace a
// DIFFERENT subset before the other finishes, e.g.:
//
//	deploy A: replace dst1 -> build A
//	deploy B: replace dst1 -> build B, replace dst2 -> build B
//	deploy A: replace dst2 -> build A
//	result: dst1=B, dst2=A — a mixed-version install
//
// Worse, replaceFile's rename-aside rollback (SwapRenameAside) can't
// distinguish "my own swap failed" from "a sibling deploy's successful
// swap raced mine" — without serialization, deploy A could observe a
// transient failure caused by deploy B's own in-flight rename and roll
// back B's already-succeeded replacement of that destination.
//
// A single exclusive lock around the whole replace+verify block turns
// two concurrent deploys into a strictly sequential pair (whichever
// acquires first runs its entire replace-all-destinations block to
// completion before the second even starts touching a file), which is
// sufficient to rule out interleaving without needing a multi-destination
// transaction/manifest: every actual mutation the review is concerned
// about (the sequence of per-dst renames in step 4) happens for one
// deploy in full before the other's begins. A manifest recording the
// expected BuildID per destination (as the review floats as an optional
// extra) would let step 5's verification also catch a THIRD-PARTY writer
// that isn't running deploy.go at all (e.g. a hand-run `cp`) — but that
// is out of scope for what two racing `go run deploy.go` operators need,
// adds a persistent-file format to design/version, and every dst is
// already independently re-verified via `--version` in step 5. The lock
// alone closes the race this review reports; the manifest is deferred as
// unnecessary complexity for that goal.
//
// The lock file at DeployLockPath is never removed after Release, by the
