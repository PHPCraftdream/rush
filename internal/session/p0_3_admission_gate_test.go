// P0-3 regression test (docs/reviews/2026-08-11-release-readiness-concurrency-and-code-review.md):
// closes a real "Add concurrently with Wait" race an earlier version of the
// P0-3 fix left in processEntry. That version checked p.ctx.Err() and then
// called p.workerWg.Add(1) as two separate, unsynchronized steps — between
// the check and the Add, a concurrent Stop() could cancel p.ctx and spin up
// its workerWg.Wait() goroutine while the counter was still 0, letting
// Wait() return (nothing registered yet) a moment before the Add(1) landed.
// Per the sync.WaitGroup contract ("calls with a positive delta that start
// when the counter is zero must happen before a Wait"), this either panics
// at runtime or lets a brand-new worker start after Stop() has already told
// its caller (App.Shutdown) that shutdown was safe — reintroducing the
// exact class of bug P0-3 exists to close, one level down. The fix gates
// both the check and the Add under one mutex (admitMu/stopping).
//
// This test exercises processEntry directly (package session, not
// session_test, specifically to reach the unexported method and fields) by
// flipping the gate manually — deterministic, rather than trying to time a
// real Stop() call against a real dispatch within a few microseconds.
//
// REVERT CHECK PROCEDURE:
//  1. In run_queue_pump.go's processEntry, replace the admitMu-guarded
//     `if p.stopping { ...release...; return }` / `p.workerWg.Add(1)` block
//     with the unsynchronized version: `if p.ctx.Err() != nil { return };
//     p.workerWg.Add(1)` (checking p.ctx.Err() instead of p.stopping, no
//     admitMu lock).
//  2. Run: go test ./internal/session -run TestP0_3_AdmissionGateRejectsAfterStopping -v
//  3. FAIL: this test sets pump.stopping = true directly (never cancels
//     pump.ctx), so the reverted p.ctx.Err() check sees a live context and
//     falls through to executeEntry — the entry gets ACKED (deleted), not
//     released back to pending. require.Len(t, pendingAfter, 1) fails.
//  4. Restore the admitMu/stopping gate and this test passes again.
