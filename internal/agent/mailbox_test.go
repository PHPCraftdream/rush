// (docs/reviews/2026-08-04-multi-agent-stability-follow-up.md, release-gate
// scenario 3): "a plain concurrent send that lands exactly in the
// final-drain-to-release window must either become the new owner or be
// guaranteed to run under the old owner — never orphaned."
//
// Before this migration, the owner's final drain (messageQueue.PopFront
// returning empty) and the reservation release (activeRequests.Del, run via
// Run()'s deferred releaseSessionReservation) were two SEPARATE, non-atomic
// steps. A concurrent submit landing in the gap between them would observe
// "still busy" (the map entry not yet deleted), append itself to
// messageQueue, and then nobody would ever look at that queue entry again —
// the owner had already decided "nothing queued" and moved on, and the
// concurrent caller had already returned believing its message was queued
// for the (already-departing) owner to pick up.
//
// This test reproduces that EXACT window deterministically — not
// probabilistically — using mailbox.testDrainSeam: a hook drainOrRelease
// invokes strictly after observing mb.submitted empty but strictly before
// flipping mb.state to mbIdle (i.e., precisely inside what is now one
// critical section but used to be the gap between two). Because
// mb.mu is held for the whole of drainOrRelease (including the hook call),
// a concurrent submit() blocks on mb.mu.Lock() until the hook returns and
// drainOrRelease's own critical section finishes — so the test does not
// need to win a race against goroutine scheduling to land the submit inside
// the window; the window is held open by the mutex until the test releases
// it.

	//     sees mbIdle -> becomes the new owner (concurrentBecameOwner ==
	//     true). This is what will actually happen here, since submit() is
	//     already blocked waiting on mb.mu when we release the seam.
	// Either way, the message is never orphaned: it either becomes owned by
	// the concurrent caller (fresh Run()) or would have been picked up by
	// the departing owner had it arrived a moment earlier (covered by the
	// sibling "WithQueuedItem" test above). What must NEVER happen is what
	// the old code allowed: the departing owner decides "nothing queued"
	// AND the concurrent caller decides "still busy, I'll just queue" —
	// both true at once, with nobody left to drain the queue.
