	// with its own stream watchdog, started strictly LATER than the
	// parent's (the parent starts timing from OnToolCall — the moment it
	// decided to delegate; the child starts timing only once its own turn
	// actually begins executing, after init and the DB preamble). Both
	// watchdogs share the same toolMaxDuration, so the parent's clock — with
	// its head start — would always reach the cap first and cancel genCtx,
	// which cascades into the child's ctx, before the child's own watchdog
	// ever gets a chance to fire on ITS cap and unwind cleanly (finish part,
	// cost transfer per task #197, goroutine dump). This grace is applied
	// uniformly to every tool-in-flight regardless of kind — it is not a
	// tool-name-keyed special case (that pattern was deliberately rejected

	// past its nominal cap, which is harmless for a plain tool and decisive
	// for a delegation. Configurable via Options.ToolCleanupGrace for tests;

	// accidental zero would silently reopen the race this constant exists
	// to close.
	//
	// HONEST SCOPE (found overstated by an @oh review of task #205's own
	// fix — corrected here rather than in a follow-up commit that could go
	// unread): 90s only guarantees the child wins the race against the
	// PARENT'S watchdog start skew — the gap between the parent's OnToolCall
	// and the child's own watchdog starting (init + DB preamble), which
	// really is sub-second to low seconds. It does NOT bound how long the
	// child may productively work before the tool call that actually wedges
	// starts. Concretely: parent fires at delegationStart + M + 90s; child
	// fires at (delegationStart + skew + workDuration) + M, where
	// workDuration is the child's own prior productive work before hitting
	// its stuck tool — unbounded, since the child's watchdog resets on every
	// tool-call boundary (see toolFinished's doc below). The child wins only
	// when skew + workDuration < 90s, i.e. only when the child wedges
	// EARLY (near-immediately after being delegated to) — the common "child
	// worked productively for minutes, THEN wedged deep into its turn" case
	// is NOT covered: the parent still force-cancels it first. What this
	// grace DOES guarantee unconditionally: the parent never fires before
	// its own toolMaxDuration+90s has elapsed since delegating, giving any
	// child that happens to wedge quickly (the case this was originally
	// observed in) real runway to clean up. A structural fix for the general
	// case would need the child to push progress signals the parent's own
	// watchdog resets on — not implemented; tracked as a follow-up, not a
	// release blocker, since the practical loss on the uncovered path is
	// diagnostic quality (finish part / goroutine dump), not correctness —
	// the parent still terminates, and task #197 already made the
	// cost-transfer step itself cancel-immune.

	// the race worse, not better: with identical toolMaxDuration+grace on
	// both sides, the 90s cancels out of the "child must fire before parent"
	// inequality algebraically, leaving the parent's head start (from
	// OnToolCall, before the child's own watchdog even starts) as the only
	// deciding factor — so the parent always still won regardless of how
	// early the child wedged. A sub-agent can never itself be waiting on a

// of this doc claimed only three cases and asserted "lk is simply never
// released for [a same-era reclaim] handoff" as the invariant covering
// every hasNext==true return, which #296/P1-C's first draft violated by
// adding a hand-back that returned hasNext==true AFTER lk had already been
// released):
//  1. mb.submitted (checked first) or mb.replacement is non-empty at the
//     time of the call, BEFORE any release attempt: pop and return it;
//     state stays mbOwned; lk is NOT touched (still held for the reclaimed
//     turn). The caller's loop runs it as the next turn under the SAME lk.
//  2. Both empty: check mb.submitted (already checked in case 1). If
//     still empty, this is the end-of-turn handoff — proceed to case 3.
//  3. Both mb.submitted and mb.replacement are empty: release lk (if non-nil) — now OUTSIDE mb.mu (#296/
//     P1-C: mb.state == mbReleasing stands in for the mutex so a hung
//     filesystem cannot stall the control plane) — then flip mb.state to
//     mbIdle. No same-process observer can see "not busy" until the OS lock
//     genuinely is gone (mbReleasing reads as busy throughout), closing the
//     HIGH-1 window described above.
//  4. Work (a submit()/interruptAndReplace()) races into mb.submitted/
//     mb.replacement WHILE case 3's release() is running. This is the ONLY

// P0-2 fix: made this function SYNCHRONOUS relative to its caller. It now waits for
// all durable enqueues to complete before returning, ensuring that no calls are lost
// between when the caller returns control and when the DB write commits. The caller
// (drainOrReleaseMerged, called from runTurn, called from Run's turn loop) is about to
// return control up its own call stack, possibly all the way out of Run() entirely.

// this function returns but before the goroutine's DB write commits would lose the call.

// largeModel is the SAME kind of runTurn-local snapshot (taken once at turn
// start, agent.go: `largeModel := a.largeModel.Get()`), NOT a fresh re-read
// of a.largeModel here: a.largeModel is mutable mid-turn via SetModels

	// Invariant: sessionLock (already declared above) protects EVERY
	// touch of currentAssistant — mutation, Clone(), and even a bare
	// len(Parts)/pointer read — because the checkpoint goroutine below
	// and the streaming callbacks (OnTextDelta, OnReasoningDelta,
	// OnToolInputStart, ...) run concurrently on separate goroutines.
	// message.Message.Clone() has no synchronization of its own, so a
	// snapshot must be taken while holding sessionLock.
	//
	// The lock must NEVER be held across a.messages.Update (the SQLite
	// write): every writer takes the lock, mutates/clones a private
	// snapshot, releases the lock, then calls Update on the snapshot
	// without the lock held. Otherwise each checkpoint tick or
	// DB-writing callback would stall the whole streaming loop for the
	// duration of a disk write. OnStepFinish drains the ticker and
	// stops the goroutine (via stopCheckpoint) before its final write;
	// the tail of Run() also calls stopCheckpoint() defensively before
	// touching currentAssistant, in case agent.Stream returned before
	// OnStepFinish ever ran (e.g. the very first provider call failed).
	//
	// checkpointGeneration fences concurrent checkpoint writes across turns:
	// each startCheckpoint increments it, the goroutine captures the current
	// value at launch, and stopCheckpoint returns immediately only after
	// observing the goroutine's done signal. This ensures a hung checkpoint
	// from turn N cannot race with a new checkpoint from turn N+1, and that
	// stopCheckpoint's 5s timeout is reflected in runWg (see P0-4 fix below).
	// P0-2: checkpointGeneration and checkpointMu synchronize all access to
	// the fencing state; the old checkpointPartsLen shared variable is gone
	// (each generation now tracks its own lastPartsLen locally).
	//
	// checkpointStop and checkpointDone are reborn on every step.
	// startCheckpoint allocates a fresh pair and launches the ticker
	// goroutine; stopCheckpoint closes checkpointStop — the goroutine's
	// dedicated exit signal — then waits on checkpointDone for it to
	// actually exit, then nils both so the next step starts clean. The
	// exit signal MUST be a dedicated channel, NOT genCtx.Done(): genCtx
	// stays alive for the whole body of Run (cancelled only by the
	// deferred cancel() at function return), so relying on it would force
	// stopCheckpoint to always hit its 5s backstop — the ~10s/turn stall
	// this code replaces. start/stop run on fantasy's single callback
	// goroutine / the Run goroutine (never concurrent with each other);
